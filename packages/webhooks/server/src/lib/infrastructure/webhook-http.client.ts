 * a pre-flight check and then resolves to `169.254.169.254` — DNS rebinding —
 * connects anyway. A custom `lookup` is the seam where the resolved address is
 * judged and either handed to the connector or refused.
 *

 * than an invitation to make a second request, because following one is the
 * simplest way to be walked to an internal address after the first hop passed.
