/**
 * This app's composition, asserted.
 *
 * Two things about the plugin list are load-bearing, and neither shows up in an
 * end-to-end run:
 *
 * 1. **Who is in it.** Drop a plugin and its routes stop existing, while
 *    everything that injects its ports `@Optional()` degrades silently — no
 *    error, no log, just a capability that quietly went away.
 * 2. **What order the migrations run in.** They are applied by walking this
 *    array with no transaction spanning plugins, so a plugin whose tables
 *    reference another's must come after it. The mistake is invisible on an
 *    already-migrated database and fails a *fresh* one, so it ships and bites
 *    the next clean install rather than its author.
 *
 * Deliberately *not* asserted: relative order beyond the migration constraint.
 * Every plugin module is global and every `onPluginInit` runs before the Nest
 * app is created, so DI order is genuinely free.
