/**
 * The admin composition, asserted.
 *
 * A browser test proves the happy path assembles, and can say nothing about the
 * two ways this list goes wrong while still rendering something plausible:
 *
 * 1. **A layout registered ahead of the shell's.** The host mounts the *first*
 *    `layout` it finds, and the shell's is what composes identity's auth gate —
 *    so a second contributor placed earlier renders every private route
 *    **ungated** while signed out. It looks like a styling accident.
 * 2. **A plugin quietly dropped.** Its routes and slot contributions stop
 *    existing with no error; the sidebar is simply shorter, and every test that
 *    does not open that page stays green.
 *
 * Both are decisions visible in `plugins.ts`, so they are pinned here rather
 * than through a browser. Relative order between slot fillers is *not* asserted
 * — slots are module-level singletons registered before the first render, so
 * that order only decides the order of items within a slot.
