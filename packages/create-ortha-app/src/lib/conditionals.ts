/**
 * `ortha:if` blocks — how one template serves every feature combination.
 *
 * A marker is any line containing the directive, whatever comment syntax wraps
 * it, so the same three forms work in TypeScript, YAML, `.env` and Markdown:
 *
 *     // ortha:if copilot
 *     import { CopilotPlugin } from '@orthacms/copilot-server';
 *     // ortha:end
 *
 *     # ortha:ifnot graphql
 *     # (REST only — no GraphQL endpoint is mounted.)
 *     # ortha:end
 *
 * The marker lines are always removed; the body survives only when the
 * condition holds. Blocks may nest, and an inner block is only reached when
 * the outer one is kept.
 *
 * Deliberately line-based rather than an expression language. The templates are
 * read far more often than they are written — someone opening
 * `plugins.ts` should see the real file with a few comments in it, not a
 * templating dialect — and every condition this needs is "is this feature on".
 *
 * **Not used for `package.json`.** Dropping lines from JSON produces a trailing
 * comma and an app that will not install, blaming the template rather than the
 * feature that was switched off; dependencies are assembled in `features.ts`
 * instead.
