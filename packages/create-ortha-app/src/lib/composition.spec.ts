 * scaffolder's `testMatch` is `src/**` and the template is data. So the one
 * thing those specs cannot check is whether *they themselves* still describe
 * the app — and that is the failure this file exists for. A plugin added to
 * `plugins.ts` and not to `EXPECTED_PLUGINS` makes `npm test` red in every app
 * generated from that day on, in the first minute of a new user's first
 * project, and nothing upstream notices.
 *
 * Both sides are read rather than re-stated. The registered list comes from the
 * rendered `plugins.ts`; each plugin's *name* comes from the package that
 * defines the factory — so this cannot drift into agreeing with a template that
 * is wrong. What it cannot see is a factory that decides its own name from its

 * installs cleanly, `npm test` stays green, and the feature is simply not
 * there. There is no route, no nav row, and no error saying why.

 * neither, and `webhooks-*` was classified a release before it was mounted.
 * Users got the packages in `node_modules` and no export/import dialogs, no
 * audience directory and no webhooks page. It was found by hand and fixed by
 * hand; every existing guard was green throughout.
 *

 * exported factory whose return type is a `…Plugin` (or the `…PluginType` /
 * `…PluginDefinition` alias some packages use). So a library that grows a
 * plugin factory in a later release fails this without anyone having touched
 * the scaffolder, which is the whole point: adding a plugin to the workspace
 * should force a decision about whether a new app mounts it.
