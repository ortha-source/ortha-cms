/**
 * The generated README, checked against the app it describes.
 *
 * Nothing read this file before. `template.spec.ts` asserted that a
 * `README.md` came out of the rename, and that was the whole of it — so the
 * document drifted exactly where a document drifts: it kept naming
 * `src/server/plugins.ts` a layout change had moved to `apps/server/src/`, and
 * its `drizzle.config.ts` recipe pointed `out` two levels above the project
 * root, which a reader following it literally discovers as a folder full of
 * SQL outside their app.
 *
 * This is the first document a new user reads and the only one that tells them
 * how to add a content type, which is the first thing they will want to do. So
 * the assertions here are about the two claims a README can actually be wrong
 * about in a way a machine can see:
 *
 * - **every path it names is a path this app has** (or one it has just told the
 *   reader to create, and there are exactly three of those, each pinned on its
 *   own below), and
 * - **every command it says to run is a command that exists** — a script in the
 *   generated manifest, resolving to a subcommand the CLI dispatches.
 *
 * Both sides are *read* rather than restated: the paths come out of the
 * rendered README and are looked for in the rendered app, and the CLI's
 * commands and layout come out of `@orthacms/cli`'s own source. A test that
 * only asserted the README contains some string would pass on a README that is
 * wrong about everything else.
