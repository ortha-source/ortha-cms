/**
 * **Language of parts** — a run of text marked as being in another language
 * (WCAG 3.1.2).
 *
 * The platform localises whole entries, which settles the *page's* language
 * (3.1.1). It says nothing about a French quotation inside an otherwise-English
 * body: a screen reader announces that passage with English phonemes, and the
 * result is unintelligible rather than merely accented. The only fix is a
 * `lang` on the passage itself, which means the body has to be able to carry
 * one — so this is a mark, stored on the run, travelling with the document.
 *
 * TipTap ships no such mark, and it is not `textStyle` with another attribute:
 * `textStyle` is a `<span style>` about appearance, and clearing formatting
 * should not silently strip a language. It is its own mark, so `Clear
 * formatting` leaves it alone.
