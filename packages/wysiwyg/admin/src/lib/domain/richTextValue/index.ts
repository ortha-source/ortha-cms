 * what to store).
 *
 * The rules themselves live in the shared kernel
 * (`@ortha-cms/content-domain`'s rich-text module), because emptiness is the
 * same question the server's `required` and the publish gate ask. What is here
 * is the editor-facing half: what to seed TipTap with, and what a closed editor
