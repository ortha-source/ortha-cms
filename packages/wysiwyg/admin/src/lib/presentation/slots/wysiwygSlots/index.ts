 * It deliberately knows nothing about the Media Library. A picker that browses

 * wiring it in directly would mean `wysiwyg-admin` importing `media-admin` —
 * making rich text unusable in an install that has no media plugin, and

 *
 * So the editor declares what it needs (something that can hand back embeds)
 * and `@ortha-cms/media-admin` provides it, the same inversion content-admin
 * uses for its own slots.
