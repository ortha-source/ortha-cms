/**
 * Two things about the panel that a browser suite cannot see, for opposite
 * reasons.
 *
 * **Where the caret starts** (`autofocus: readOnly ? false : 'end'`) looks like
 * a focus question, and as a focus question it is unobservable: a read-only
 * ProseMirror renders `contenteditable="false"` with no `tabindex`, so
 * `view.focus()` is a no-op and flipping the guard changes nothing a browser
 * can be asked about. But focus is not what the option does first — TipTap
 * resolves it to a **selection** and puts it in the editor's state, whether or
 * not the DOM can take focus. That selection is a document fact, readable off
 * the live editor, and it differs by the whole document's length between the
 * two modes. So this is a state assertion that happens to be about the caret,
 * not a caret test in jsdom.
 *
 * **The image with no alt** is the reverse: the browser can see the rendered
 * `alt`, but the rule is a *pair* of opposite requirements — the author's own
 * screen reader must not meet an unnamed graphic while they work, and the
 * stored HTML must carry the real value, empty included. A test that checked
 * only one of them would pass for a build that satisfied it by breaking the
 * other, which is the likelier mistake of the two.
 *
 * The editor is reached through `.tiptap`'s `editor` back-reference — the one
 * TipTap itself puts on the view's DOM node — so what is asserted is the
 * instance the component built, not one this file configured to match.
