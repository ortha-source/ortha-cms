/**
 * The plugin factory's job beyond wiring: refuse a content model that cannot be
 * served over GraphQL, at **composition time**.
 *
 * Both checks exist because the schema is built lazily and per grant set. Left
 * to the builder, a modelling mistake boots cleanly and then 500s on the first
 * request from whichever workspace happens to be granted the offending type —
 * a production surprise instead of a failed boot, and one that never fires in a
 * staging workspace granted something else.
