/**
 * Re-reads entries **by id, with expansions**, batching every request made in
 * the same execution tick into one query per (type, locale, cap).
 *
 * ## Why this exists
 *
 * The REST expansion attaches one level: `?relations=preview` hands back linked
 * entries as full records, but *their* relations and media are absent — which is
 * exactly what stops one request walking the whole content graph. GraphQL
 * callers nest anyway, so something has to resolve level two and below, and the
 * naive version is an N+1: one query per linked entry per field.
 *
 * ## How it avoids that
 *
 * One primitive, used by every nested resolver: *load these ids of this type,
 * with these expansions*. Requests are collected across the tick, so all
 * siblings at a level coalesce — the cost is one query per level, not per row —
 * and the union of the fields they asked for is expanded in a single pass.
 *
 * ## Why it needs no new query code
 *
 * The batch is a plain `PublicEntriesQuery.list` with a `{ field: 'id', op:
 * 'in' }` filter. `id` is filterable on the public surface and `in` is a
 * supported operator, so the load runs through the **same** `readableWhere` as
 * every other public read: a draft, a soft-deleted row, or an entry from another
 * workspace is invisible here for the same reason and by the same code. A
 * bespoke `WHERE id IN (…)` would have been a second visibility rule to keep in
 * step, which is the one thing this design refuses to have.
 *
 * One cost worth naming: the batch does not narrow `?fields=`, so it reads every
 * value column of the parents even when the caller only wanted their relations.
 * Narrowing it would mean naming at least one value field, and there is no
 * spelling for "no values" (an empty `?fields=` means "no preference"). One
 * over-wide read per level beats one query per row, and the shallow case — where
 * a page's own columns dominate the cost — never reaches this class at all.
