/**
 * `POST /api/v1/graphql` — the public content API over GraphQL.
 *
 * **An ordinary Nest controller, not `@nestjs/graphql`.** Two things fall out of
 * that, and both are the reason for it:
 *
 * - The **same guards** run here as on every other `/v1` route, as the same
 *   objects. `ApiTokenGuard` authenticates the bearer and checks `content:read`
 *   against the token's scope; `ApiTokenWorkspaceGuard` resolves which of the
 *   token's workspaces this request targets. There is no second authentication
 *   path to keep in step, which is exactly the sort of drift a security boundary
 *   cannot afford.
 * - The **schema can vary per request**. `GraphQLModule.forRoot` fixes one
 *   schema at boot; this builds (and caches) one per workspace grant set, so a
 *   token can no more enumerate the content model here than it can through
 *   `/v1/content-types`.
 *
 * `@RequirePermissions(CONTENT_READ)` is the floor for touching the endpoint at
 * all. It cannot be the whole story — one endpoint serves reads and writes — so
 * each mutation resolver asserts its own permission through the `assert` closure
 * built below, against the same `AccessPolicy` this guard consults.
 *
 * **A resolver failure is an HTTP 200 with an `errors` array.** That is how
 * GraphQL works, and it is the one thing a consumer porting from REST has to
 * adjust to: the status they used to branch on now travels in
 * `extensions.status`.
 *
 * **No `OriginGuard`**, for the same reason the REST write routes carry none: a
 * bearer token is never sent ambiently by a browser, so there is nothing to
 * forge, and demanding an `Origin` header would reject every server-side client.
