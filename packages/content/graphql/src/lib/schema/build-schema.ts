/**
 * Builds the GraphQL schema **one workspace's content grants can see**.
 *
 * The schema is derived per grant set rather than once at boot, and that is the
 * load-bearing decision of this whole package. The REST API prunes
 * `/v1/content-types` and 404s an ungranted `:typeName` precisely so a token
 * cannot enumerate the content model beyond what its workspace exposes. A single
 * global schema would hand every token the entire model through introspection —
 * a strictly worse leak than the one REST goes out of its way to avoid. So an
 * ungranted type does not appear here at all, and naming it is a validation
 * error before a resolver runs: the same answer as REST's 404, arrived at
 * earlier and without a round trip.
 *
 * Everything below is a pure function of `(registry, granted)` — no Nest, no
 * database, no request — which is what makes the result cacheable and this file
 * unit-testable on its own.
