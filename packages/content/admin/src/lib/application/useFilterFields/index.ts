 *
 * Deliberately **not** derived from `useContentSchema`: the surface is
 * recursive and the server owns the whitelist that decides which paths reach
 * SQL. Deriving it client-side would reintroduce the flat
 * `filterFieldsFromSchema` mirror — with a graph to walk, that drift becomes
 * user-visible 400s. Content types are code-defined, so the result only
 * changes on deploy (a standard staleTime avoids refetch churn).
 *
 * Returns the server-derived fields alongside the load state; callers append
 * their own slot-contributed fields (`RECORDS_FILTER_FIELDS_SLOT`), keeping
 * the rules-of-hooks-sensitive slot loop at the call site where it already
 * lives.
