 * doesn't create a second row), applies the shared `@orthacms/content-domain`
 * {@link canPublish} kernel gate before publishing (the single validation source,
 * the same rule the editor's publish gate shows), and exposes the entry lifecycle
 * mutations. Cache invalidation lives in the underlying mutations.
 *
 * Takes the stable `typeName` so it can be called unconditionally (before the
 * schema resolves); the schema and publishable flag are supplied per {@link submit}.
 *
 * `editorKey` identifies the current edit target (mode + record id + create-body
 * params such as the target locale). The editor is **not** remounted when the
 * route flips between `/new`, `/:id`, and `/new?locale=…` (the same component
 * renders all three — see `ContentLibraryPage`), so this hook's state survives
 * those transitions; the key lets it clear the remembered `createdId` when the
 * target genuinely changes. Without it, after creating record A a subsequent
 * "create a translation" (a fresh `/new` for another locale) would keep A's id
 * and issue a **PATCH against A** instead of a POST — overwriting A and creating
 * no sibling. The key must **not** change within a single create session (e.g. a
 * create that succeeds then fails to publish), so a retry still targets the draft.
