 * Reads one entry for the editor's edit mode via the content gateway.
 * `initialData` (seeded from the records-list cache when the row was opened from
 * the table) keeps the form instant on the common path; a deep link / reload
 * with no cache simply fetches. Disabled when there's no id. The cache key is
 * workspace-scoped.
 *
 * **`staleTime`** stops the editor re-reading a record it was *just handed*. Two
 * paths seed this cache with a canonical copy — every entry write primes it with
 * the server's response, and a create then navigates to `/:type/:id`, mounting
 * this query — and with no `staleTime` that fresh record was thrown away and
 * re-fetched on arrival, so every save cost an extra round-trip for data already
 * in hand. Correctness is unaffected: writes still invalidate (which ignores
 * `staleTime`), so nothing this app changes can go unnoticed. `initialDataUpdatedAt`
 * is what keeps that honest for cache-seeded opens — list data carries the age of
 * the list read, so a stale row refetches instead of being trusted for another
 * window.
