/**
 * How many times an Insights query is allowed to ask before it gives up.
 *
 * This pins an invariant of the **Insights page**
 * (`docs/artifacts/insights.html`), which owns the reasoning: the page's whole
 * premise is that one card fails on its own, and TanStack's default of three
 * attempts with exponential backoff leaves a broken card sitting on a skeleton
 * for about seven seconds first — which reads as a hang, not as a failure. The
 * queries themselves live here, in the package that owns the data, so this is
 * where the count is observable.
 *
 * Nothing else states it. The e2e suite can see a failed card but not how many
 * requests were spent reaching it, and reverting every `retry: 1` in this file
 * to the default broke no test anywhere.
