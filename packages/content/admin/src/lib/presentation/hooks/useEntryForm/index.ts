 *
 * **Seeding, and when it is refused (`ORT-230`).** The form re-seeds on
 * `initialValues` **identity**, which is how a freshly read record reaches the
 * screen. But the entry read is refetched in the background — on window focus,
 * on reconnect, on any remount past its `staleTime` — so that identity also
 * changes when *somebody else* saved the record while the author was typing.
 * Re-seeding there replaced the author's unsaved work with the colleague's,
 * silently: nothing navigated, so the unsaved-changes guard never fired, and it
 * could not have — the re-seed sets `values` to the very object dirtiness is
 * measured against, so it **disarms** the guard on its way past.
 *
 * So a re-seed is refused while the form holds edits, and the refusal is
 * reported ({@link EntryFormState.seedRefused}) rather than swallowed: a silent
 * refusal is the same class of bug as the silent overwrite. "Edits" means any
 * {@link EntryFormState.setValue} — not "differs from the seed" — because with
 * the notice on screen a needless refusal costs a click and a wrong adoption
 * costs the author their work.
 *
 * Two escapes, and both are needed:
 *
 * - **`seedKey`** identifies *which* record (or create session) the form is
 *   for. The editor is reused rather than remounted as the route moves between
 *   records, so a changed key is a different form, never a conflict: the
 *   incoming values are adopted whatever this one holds. Without it, discarding
 *   at the unsaved-changes
 *   prompt and opening a cached second record would leave the first one's
 *   values on screen under a conflict notice.
 * - **{@link EntryFormState.acceptSeed}** adopts on demand. The editor's save
 *   path calls it, and must: `useSaveEntry` primes the read-one cache with the
 *   write response inside `onSuccess`, which runs **before** the caller's
 *   `.then()` — so by the time a save could clear the edit flag, its own new
 *   seed has already arrived and been refused. Clearing the flag is therefore
 *   not enough; `acceptSeed` latches an adoption for the next render.
