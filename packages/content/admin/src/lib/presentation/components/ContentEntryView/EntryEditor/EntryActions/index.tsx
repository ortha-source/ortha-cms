 * through a portal from inside the editor, so the handlers, the busy state and

 * own contents (including the delete confirmation and any contributed overlay).
 *
 * It also owns the **third** gate on that button. `content:publish` decides
 * whether it renders at all and the publish gate decides whether the values are
 * complete; a contribution to {@link ENTRY_PUBLISH_GUARD_SLOT} may then refuse
 * the publish for a reason this package never learns. With nothing contributed
 * the button is exactly what the first two gates made it.
