/**
 * The grant gate on the **resource** path.
 *
 * `resources/read` is the one way into this provider that does not pass through
 * `ToolRegistry.call`, so it is the one place a missing check would not be
 * caught by the tool authorization the registry owns. The rule
 * (`mcp:I-23`) is deliberately narrow: a content type the workspace was **not
 * granted** must answer a `resources/read` exactly as a type that does not
 * exist, so a client cannot enumerate the content model by asking for schemas
 * one URI at a time.
 *
 * ## Why the fixture is shaped the way it is
 *
 * "Indistinguishable" is a claim about **one name asked in two worlds**, not
 * about two names asked in one. The refusal embeds the name that was asked for
 * (`Unknown content type "x".`), so comparing the answer for an ungranted `x`
 * against the answer for an unknown `y` compares two sentences that differ by
 * construction and proves nothing either way. So each case below builds two
 * providers — one where `test_ungranted` is registered and withheld, one where
 * it was never registered — and asks both for the same URI.
 *
 * That distinction is exactly what the server-e2e suite is missing today: its
 * `-32002` case reads `ortha://content-type/never_granted`, a name no registry
 * holds, which pins *unknown URI* and would pass unchanged against a
 * `readResource` that consulted no grant set at all. Only a type that exists
 * and was withheld can tell the gate apart from its absence.
