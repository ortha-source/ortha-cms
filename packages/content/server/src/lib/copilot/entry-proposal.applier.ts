 *
 * A create is a whole row: `coerceValues` stamps every declared field, so each
 * shared field the change did not name arrives as `null`, and the i18n
 * extension propagates a create's shared columns **outward** onto every sibling
 * — blanking the record in every other language, and silently so where the
 * siblings are all drafts. Doing it correctly means inheriting the source row's
 * shared values at apply time, which is knowledge the i18n plugin owns; hence
 * `i18n_propose_translation` / `i18n_propose_bulk_translation`.
 *
 * The schemas dropped `localeGroupId`, so nothing produces one any more. This
 * guards the one case that outlives a schema: a proposal drafted before the
 * change whose apply failed, left `pending`, and is carried out later.
