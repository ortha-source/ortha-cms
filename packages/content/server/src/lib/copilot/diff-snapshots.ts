/**
 * Diffs two revision snapshots field by field, in schema order, returning
 * **only what changed**.
 *
 * Returning only the changes is the point. The admin's dialog renders every
 * field because a person scanning a table wants the unchanged rows for context;
 * a model reasoning about "what did this edit do" gets nothing from forty
 * `changed: false` rows except a larger prompt. The count of unchanged fields is
 * reported separately, so the answer can still say "3 of 41 fields changed".
 *
 * The comparison rules mirror `content-admin`'s `diffRevision` exactly —
 * empties collapse so `null` → `''` is not an edit, and link sets compare
 * **order-sensitively** because the owning side's order is meaningful data. The
 * duplication is deliberate for now: the two sides type their schema
 * differently (`SerializedContentType` here, the admin's `ContentTypeDetail`
 * there), so sharing this through `@ortha-cms/content-domain` means unifying
 * those types first — a refactor, not a feature. If the rules ever disagree,
 * that is the fix, not a third copy.
