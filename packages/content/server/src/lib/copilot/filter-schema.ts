 * (`{and: […]}` / `{or: […]}`) or a rule (`{field, op, value}`) — so the model
 * emits exactly what the admin's UI emits and the same parser validates both.
 * **The model never writes SQL**: `parseFilterTree` checks every path against a
 * schema derived from the content type, so an unknown field or an ungranted
 * relation hop is a rejected filter, not a query.
 *
 * `$ref`/`$defs` are deliberately avoided — a recursive schema is exactly the
 * thing small models handle worst, and our own `validateToolInput` ignores
 * `$ref` anyway. Two literal levels of nesting cover every filter the admin's
 * own query builder can produce, and a deeper one still *works*: the validator
 * only checks what it is given, and the real depth limit is the parser's.

/**
 * The filterable paths, flattened for a model.
 *
 * `WireFilterField` carries a `group` breadcrumb for the admin's picker UI,
 * which is noise here — a model wants the dotted path, the coercion type, and
 * the allowed values for an enum. Trimming it also keeps `admin_content_types`
 * affordable on a type with a wide relation graph.
 *
 * **`wire` alone is the picker's list, which is narrower than what SQL
 * accepts** — and the gap is not cosmetic. `scalarWireOf` pushes `status` and
 * the type's own fields; the envelope timestamps, `publishedAt` above all, are
 * whitelisted for SQL and deliberately kept out of the admin UI. A person does
 * not need `publishedAt` in a picker — they have a **Modified** badge in front
 * of them. A model has no badge, and without this path cannot express
 * "published content with unpublished changes" at all: it falls back to
 * `status eq draft` and counts never-published drafts as edits, or invents
 * `status eq "modified"` and gets an enum error. Both answers are confidently
 * wrong, which is exactly what the filter grammar's "only paths listed by
 * admin_content_types are accepted" is supposed to prevent.
 *
 * So `sqlFields` — the ROOT level of the very `FilterSchema` that is the
 * security boundary — is unioned in. Reading the boundary is the opposite of
 * a second source of truth: a field added to `scalarFieldsOf` later is offered
 * here automatically, with {@link PARAMETER_BACKED_FIELDS} the one stated
 * exception. Relation-level envelope paths (`author.publishedAt`) stay
 * unadvertised: SQL still accepts them, and listing every hop's envelope would
 * cost more prompt than it buys.
