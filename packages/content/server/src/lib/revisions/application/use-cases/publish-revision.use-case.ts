/**
 * **Publish a specific version** — make any version the entry's live one, so an
 * editor can switch back to an earlier version and publish it (not only the
 * newest draft).
 *
 * Publishing marks the **chosen version itself** live: it is flipped to
 * `published` in place and the previously-published one to `superseded` (via
 * {@link PublishEntryUseCase}). Publishing an **earlier** version first
 * re-applies its content onto the live row (through
 * {@link RestoreRevisionUseCase}, with `appendRevision: false`) so the live
 * document matches what is published — but records **no new version** for it.
 * Publishing v2 therefore leaves the timeline at its existing length with v2
 * marked live, rather than minting a v6 copy of v2 on every publish.
 *
 * History is still never rewritten or deleted — only version *statuses* move,
 * which is what publish means. One consequence to know: after publishing an
 * earlier version the **latest** version is no longer the live content (it is a
 * newer draft that was not published). The timeline distinguishes the two —
 * "Live" marks the published version, "Current" the newest one — and the next
 * save appends a version equal to the live row again.
 *
 * Publishing re-validates through the publish gate, so an incomplete old version
 * surfaces the same `422 { issues }` a normal publish would (the content has
 * already been re-applied in that case, leaving it live as a draft — a
 * deliberate, recoverable state, not a rewrite of history).
