 * Every public read defaults to published-only, which is the API's headline
 * rule. A write-scoped token needs to widen it — otherwise creating a draft
 * returns a record that is then invisible forever, and the creator cannot poll
 * its own work. Widening is safe for exactly that caller and no other: a token
 * that may read drafts is one that could have published them anyway.
 *
 * A **guard** rather than a check inside the query service, so the rule has one
 * home and applies to every route the moment it is added to the controller —
 * including ones that reach the drafts indirectly (a translations preview, a
 * relation expansion) and would otherwise each need to remember.
 *
 * `content:update` is the probe rather than `content:read`, because read is
 * exactly what both scopes hold; update is what separates them.
