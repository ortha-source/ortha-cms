/**
 * The write side of the public content API.
 *
 * **A thin edge over the admin's write pipeline, deliberately** — the opposite
 * call from the read side, and for the opposite reason. The read stated its own
 * WHERE because `EntriesService`'s knobs select rows a token must never see, so
 * reaching through it would have made the visibility rule an argument about what
 * was *not* passed. A write has no such hazard and a great deal more to get
 * right: `EntryWriterService` already owns field validation, relation-delta
 * application, media-target checks, revision numbering serialized by a per-entry
 * advisory lock, the transactional outbox, and the i18n extension's sibling sync
 * (which demotes rewritten published translations and re-validates them). A
 * second implementation of any of that is how you get duplicate version numbers
 * and translations that quietly drift. So this class adds exactly three things
 * the writer does not know about — the locator, the grant gate (in the
 * controller), and the public wire shape — and delegates the rest.
 *
 * **Responses are re-read through the public projection** rather than mapped
 * from the writer's `EntryRecord`. It costs one SELECT per write and buys the
 * guarantee that what a write returns is byte-identical in shape to what a read
 * returns — including the reference fields the public `values` omits, which a
 * hand-written mapper would have to remember to strip every time the field
 * vocabulary grows.
 *
 * **No `OriginGuard`.** The admin's write controllers carry it because they are
 * cookie-authenticated and therefore CSRF-able. A bearer token is not sent
 * ambiently by a browser, so there is nothing to forge here — and requiring an
 * `Origin` header would break every non-browser client, which is all of them.
