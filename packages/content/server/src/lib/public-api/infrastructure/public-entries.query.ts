 * the same ILIKE search predicate and the same query-builder filter engine, so
 * one query language covers both surfaces — but it is deliberately **not** built
 * on `EntriesService` itself. Several of that service's knobs (`?deleted=only`
 * most obviously) select rows this API must never serve, and reaching through it
 * to subtract them would make the visibility rule an argument about what was
 * *not* passed. Instead the public read states its own WHERE, so "what can a
 * token see?" is answerable by reading one method:
 *
 * - the **workspace** the request resolved to, always;
 * - **published only**, on publishable types — a draft is unfinished work and
 *   never leaves the admin;
 * - **not soft-deleted**, on paranoid types;
 * - the bound `CONTENT_ENTRY_EXTENSION`'s scope, so a localized type reads the
 *   requested locale (and the same rules the admin gets) for free.
 *
 * `?search=` and `?filter=` narrow that set further; neither can widen it, since

     * That asymmetry is the point. A **group** id names a whole translation
     * group, so the locale is what picks the row out of it; `LIMIT 1` never has
     * to break a tie. An **entry id** already names exactly one row, so AND-ing
     * the locale scope onto it can do nothing except turn a valid id into a 404
     * whenever that row is not in the default locale. That used to be the
     * behaviour, documented as a sharp edge; the write API made it untenable,
     * since updating a German article by its own id would have needed
     * `?locale=de` appended to a request that already named the row uniquely.
     *
     * The narrowing is safe because `liveWhere` still carries the whole of the
     * *visibility* rule — workspace, publish state, soft delete. The extension's
     * `listScope` is, per its own name and its one implementation, about
     * choosing rows out of a *set*; a request that names one row has already
     * chosen.
     *
     * What the asymmetry must **not** cost is validation. Dropping the scope
     * from an id read also dropped the only thing that looks at `?locale=`, so
     * `?locale=zz` went from a 400 to being silently ignored — a typo that
     * quietly returns another language's content, on a contract that says
     * every route taking a locale rejects an unknown one. Hence the discarded
     * call below: `listScope` validates as well as narrows (see the port's
     * docs), and only the narrowing is unwanted here.
