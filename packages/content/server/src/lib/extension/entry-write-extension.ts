/**
 * The **entry-write extension port** — how a downstream plugin stores state of
 * its own *about* an entry, inside the entry's own write transaction and inside
 * the entry's own version history.
 *
 * Content-server declares the port, calls it from `EntryWriterService`, and
 * records what it returns in the revision snapshot's `extra` bag;
 * `@orthacms/segments-server` binds one for reader entitlements, so who may read
 * a record is set on Save, committed with the record, captured by the version,
 * and put back when a version is restored.
 *
 * ## Why not a second HTTP call
 *
 * Nothing forced this port on us — segments already had a `PUT` of its own, and
 * the admin could call it after saving. Three properties are what it buys, none
 * of which a second request has:
 *
 * - **One transaction.** The entry, its links, its audiences and the version
 *   recording all three commit together or not at all. Two requests can land
 *   half a change: an entry saved and its restriction not applied.
 * - **A truthful version.** A revision is built *inside* the write, so a
 *   separate later request could only ever be captured by the **next** save —
 *   the version would record the access the entry used to have.
 * - **A restorable one.** Restoring version 3 re-applies its snapshot through
 *   the same writer, so the extension's own state travels with it. Without that,
 *   "go back to Tuesday" would put Tuesday's words in front of today's readers.
 *
 * ## Why a registry rather than a DI token
 *
 * Nest has **no multi-provider**: two dynamic modules binding one token do not
 * merge, the second silently replaces the first. For this port the loss would be
 * silent in the worst way — an extension that stopped being called writes
 * nothing and captures nothing, so a restriction quietly stops applying. So a
 * plugin registers through {@link entryWriteExtensionRegistrar}, the same shape
 * and the same reason as `contentReadScopeRegistrar` and `copilotToolsRegistrar`.
 *
 * ## Why not `CONTENT_ENTRY_EXTENSION`
 *
 * That port is a documented **single binding** and i18n holds it. It also
 * answers a different question: it extends how *this package's own* row is
 * written (envelope columns, sibling sync). This one is about state a
 * **different plugin** owns, in a table content-server knows nothing about, and
 * the two must be able to coexist — an i18n installation with segments enabled
 * is the ordinary case, not a conflict.
 *
 * ## Two rules an implementation must keep
 *
 * **Use the executor you are handed, never a connection of your own.** It is the
 * save's transaction; a write on any other connection commits separately and
 * takes the atomicity above with it.
 *
 * **`capture` is called for every snapshot, `apply` only when asked.** A save
 * that carried nothing for an extension must leave that extension's state alone
 * — but its *version* still has to record what the state was, or restoring that
 * version would read as "this had no audiences" and open the entry up.
