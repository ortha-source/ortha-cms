/**
 * The **publish guard port** — the seam a downstream plugin uses to refuse a
 * publish, without this package knowing why.
 *
 * Content-server declares the port and consults it from the publish use-cases;
 * an implementing plugin (`@orthacms/protection-server`, for approval rules)
 * registers a guard through {@link contentPublishGuardRegistrar}. Every
 * registered guard must allow the publish for it to proceed — a refusal from
 * any one of them refuses.
 *
 * ## Where it sits in the publish path
 *
 * Third, and last:
 *
 * 1. `content:publish` — the `PermissionsGuard` on the route (403; the admin
 *    never rendered the button).
 * 2. The **publish gate** — required field values and required relations, which
 *    `Entry.publish` enforces (422, with the failing checks).
 * 3. **This port** (409 by default, and whatever else a guard asks for).
 *
 * The order is load-bearing and the bypass in {@link ContentPublishGuardContext}
 * passes **only the third**: an entry that fails the publish gate stays
 * unpublishable for an administrator too, because "is this entry complete" has
 * exactly one owner and it is not this port.
 *
 * ## Why a registry rather than a DI token
 *
 * The same reason `contentReadScopeRegistrar` documents: Nest has **no
 * multi-provider**, so two dynamic modules binding one token do not merge — the
 * second silently replaces the first. For a read scope that means content
 * quietly becoming visible; here it would mean a publish rule quietly switched
 * off, which is worse, because the installation that bought the rule is the one
 * that would never notice. So registration is a runtime `register(...)` call
 * against a registry this module owns.
 *
 * ## Two constraints on an implementation
 *
 * **It runs inside the publish transaction.** A guard reads whatever it needs
 * through the ambient unit of work, and the events it returns are appended to
 * the outbox with the status write, so a refusal leaves nothing behind and an
 * allowed bypass cannot lose its audit row.
 *
 * **It authorizes; it does not validate.** A guard that inspected field values
 * would be a second opinion on the question the publish gate already answers,
 * and the two would diverge (ADR-0015). Refuse on *who is asking* and *what
 * they have arranged*, never on what the entry contains.
