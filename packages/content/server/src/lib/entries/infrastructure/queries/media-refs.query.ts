 * resolver lookup across every media id; an asset that can't be resolved
 * (deleted / cross-workspace) is kept **in order** as an id-only `missing` ref,
 * so a `multiple` field's list never runs shorter than what was stored.
 *
 * Shared by the entry-editor read (`GET …/:id/media`, against the live row's
 * values) and the revision preview (against a snapshot's values), so the two
 * can't drift. A no-op returning `{}` when no media resolver is bound.
