 * paths, the relation-hop budget, the workspace scoping of every relation
 * subquery, and the 400 on a malformed tree are all inherited rather than
 * re-implemented. `@orthacms/alarms-server` evaluates its rules through this,
 * which is what makes "the rule I saved from the list means what the list
 * showed me" true by construction rather than by review.
 *
 * Two deliberate differences from the list query:
 *
 * - **No locale scoping.** The entries extension's `listScope` narrows a list
 *   to the active locale; a rule is a statement about the collection, so it
 *   must see every translation. The extension's *virtual filter fields* are
 *   still wired, so a rule may filter on them explicitly.
 * - **Trashed rows are excluded, always.** There is no trash view here, and a
 *   tombstoned row is not something anyone can act on.
