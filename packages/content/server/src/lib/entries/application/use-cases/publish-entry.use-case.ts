 * row against the publish gate (values via the kernel + required link-managed
 * relations via persistence), lets the {@link Entry} domain model apply the
 * `draft → published` transition, then re-stamps `status`/`published_at`.
 *
 * HTTP behavior is preserved: 400 on a non-publishable type, 404 on a missing
 * live row, and `422 { message, issues }` when the gate fails — the value issues
 * take precedence (relations aren't even counted when the values are invalid),
