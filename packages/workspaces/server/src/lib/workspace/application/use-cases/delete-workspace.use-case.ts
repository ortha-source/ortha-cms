/**
 * Permanently deletes a workspace. Three different mechanisms clear its rows,
 * and which one applies is a property of what the rows *are*:
 *
 * - **Cascade** — `memberships`, `workspace_content` and copilot's tables carry
 *   an FK to `workspaces`, so the database removes them.
 * - **Refuse** — content **entries** are workspace-scoped by a plain uuid with
 *   no FK, and they are authored records, so the delete is refused with
 *   `WorkspaceNotEmptyError` (→ 409) while any remain. A user deletes their
 *   content deliberately; we never do it for them.
 * - **Purge** — the rest of the cross-plugin rows (media assets and folders, a
 *   token's workspace bucket) are pure scoping with no independent meaning, so
 *   {@link WorkspacePurgeRegistry} deletes them in this transaction. See
 *   `WorkspacePurger` for why they can't simply carry a foreign key.
 *
 * Drains `workspace.deleted` (carrying the actor), where the activity
 * subscriber turns it into the audit row. 404s an unknown workspace.
 *
 * Loads the aggregate under the workspace's exclusive content lock
 * ({@link WorkspaceRepository.findByIdForContentMutation}), so a concurrent
 * entry create can't slip a row in between the count and the delete.
