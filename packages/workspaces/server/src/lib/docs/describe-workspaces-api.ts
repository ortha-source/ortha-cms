/**
 * The workspaces plugin's pass over the host's OpenAPI document.
 *
 * `@nestjs/swagger` reads the request side of these routes from their DTOs, but
 * every *response* is a bare `interface` — `WorkspaceView`, `{ count: number }`
 * — which is erased at compile time and carries no metadata, so the scanner
 * emits `{ '200': { description: '' } }` and a consumer learns nothing. Rather
 * than turn eleven view types into decorated classes, this pass writes the
 * schemas straight onto the finished document
 * (`packages/bootstrap/server/AGENTS.md` → "The response-schema gap").
 *
 * Pure: it takes the document and mutates only the paths this plugin owns.
