 * Generation config for the workspaces plugin's schema. `db:generate`
 * (the @ortha-cms/nx plugin) runs drizzle-kit against this. Generation
 * only diffs the schema against the snapshot — it never connects to a
 * database, so no `dbCredentials` (and no secret) is needed here.
 *
 * The `memberships` table carries a cross-package FK to identity's `users`
 * table; the generated SQL references `users(id)` without creating it (identity
 * owns and migrates that table, applied first by the host's db:migrate).
