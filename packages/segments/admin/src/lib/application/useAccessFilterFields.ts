 * Resolved server-side by the segments plugin's virtual-field subqueries, so
 * "every article Acme can read" is one rule in the same filter tree as
 * everything else, saveable as a view and replayable as an alarm rule.
 *
 * Empty until the audiences load, and empty for a workspace that is offered
 * none — a field whose value list is empty is a rule nobody can complete.
 *
 * **Scoped to the open workspace**, like the entry editor's tab: filtering by an
 * audience this workspace was never offered would be a question about content it
 * cannot restrict that way.
 *
 * The operator sets are deliberately narrow, and the omission of negation is the
 * important one: `ne` would negate *inside* the subquery — "has some allowed
 * audience other than Acme" — which an entry that also allows Acme satisfies.
 * That reads as "not visible to Acme" and is not it. Offering it would build
 * rules the server refuses, which reaches the user as "couldn't load this
 * collection" over a rule the picker itself proposed.
