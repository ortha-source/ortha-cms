 * It is cached because the read path needs it **synchronously**: the predicate
 * is assembled inside the query builder and cannot await, so a reader's tags
 * have to become segment ids before the query is built. The set is bounded by
 * how many audiences a business has and changes only when an administrator
 * edits one, so a full reload on write is cheaper than any invalidation scheme
 * worth writing.
 *
 * Loaded in `onApplicationBootstrap`, which runs inside `app.init()`: a
 * catalogue that cannot be read aborts start-up rather than leaving a server
 * that serves restricted content as though nothing were configured.
