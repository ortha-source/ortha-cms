 * The segmentation plugin — who may **read** published content.
 *
 * Register it after `ContentPlugin`, whose read-scope port it binds:

 * ```typescript
 * createServer({
 *   plugins: [
 *     ContentPlugin(config.plugins.content),
 *     SegmentsPlugin({ resolver: myResolver }),
 *   ],
 * });
 * ```
 *
 * **Registering it changes nothing on its own.** With no segment created in the
 * admin the catalogue is empty, no predicate is emitted, and every read costs
 * exactly what it did before — which is the state every existing installation
 * is in, and the first property to keep true when changing the read scope.
