/**
 * The enforcement — one predicate AND-ed onto every public content read.
 *
 * ```sql
 * COALESCE((
 *   SELECT NOT (ea.deny && $reader)
 *      AND (cardinality(ea.allow) = 0 OR ea.allow && $reader)
 *   FROM entry_access ea WHERE ea.entry_id = article.id
 * ), true)
 * ```
 *
 * That is `canRead` from the kernel, in SQL, and the correspondence is worth
 * keeping line for line: the deny check first, an empty allow list meaning
 * everyone, otherwise an intersection. The kernel's spec test is what says the
 * three rules are right; this is what says the database agrees.
 *
 * **`COALESCE(…, true)` is the load-bearing half.** An entry with no row is
 * unrestricted — the state every entry is in until somebody decides otherwise —
 * so the subquery returning `NULL` has to read as "yes". Written without it, the
 * whole library would go dark the moment the plugin was installed.
 *
 * **An empty reader still works.** `&& '{}'` is false either way: the anonymous
 * reader is denied by nothing and admitted by no allow list, which is exactly
 * the intent.
 *
 * Emitted **only when a segment exists**. With none, the scope returns
 * `undefined`, no fragment is added, and the read is byte-for-byte what it was
 * before — which is what makes installing this plugin a no-op until it is used.
