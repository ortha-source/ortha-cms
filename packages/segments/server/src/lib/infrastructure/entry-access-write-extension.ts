 * - The revision taken by that same save captures the access it applied — not
 *   the access it replaced, which is all a later separate request could ever
 *   manage.
 * - Restoring a version puts its audiences back with its words. "Go back to
 *   Tuesday" that restored Tuesday's draft in front of today's readers would be
 *   the quiet half of a restore nobody thinks to check.
 *
