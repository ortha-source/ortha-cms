 * Every row of one entry's **locale group**, including the entry itself.

 * Access is not a translated field. "Who may read this" is a fact about the
 * record, not about the German wording of it, so a decision made on one locale
 * has to reach every locale — the same reading content already gives a
 * non-localized field, which i18n propagates to the siblings on save. Left
 * per-row, an editor who restricted the English article published the German one
 * to everyone without ever seeing a screen that said so.
 *
 * **This reads content's own columns, not i18n's service.** `locale` and
 * `locale_group_id` are added by content's table builder when a type declares
 * `i18n: true`, so the group is answerable from the type in hand; going through
 * `@orthacms/i18n-server` would make an entitlement rule depend on a plugin the
 * deployment may not have installed, and the honest fallback there — treat the
 * entry as alone — is the same thing a non-localized type already gets.
 *
 * **Soft-deleted siblings are included, deliberately**, exactly as i18n's own
 * propagation includes them: a locale in the trash comes back on restore, and it
 * must come back with the group's access rather than with whatever it held on
 * the day it was deleted.
