/**
 * Carries out an accepted `segments.setEntryAccess` proposal.
 *
 * It writes through **`EntryAccessService.setForGroup`**, the same method the
 * entry save's extension and the `PUT` route use, so an accepted proposal cannot
 * mean anything the other two do not: both lists replaced wholesale, two empty
 * ones deleting the row, the workspace-scope check applied, and every language of
 * the record written together.
 *
 * **It appends no revision, and that is the honest reading.** A save carries
 * access because the record is being written; this changes only who may read
 * what is already there, exactly as the `PUT` route does. The entry's own
 * timeline is a history of its content — the proposal row is where "the copilot
 * restricted this, and who accepted it" is recorded.
 *
 * The workspace grant is re-checked here rather than trusted from the proposal:
 * a proposal can sit between being drafted and being accepted, and a type
 * ungranted in that window must not be written through an old card.
