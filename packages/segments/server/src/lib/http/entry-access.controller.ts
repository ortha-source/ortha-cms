/**
 * One entry's access — read it, replace it.
 *
 * A `PUT`, not a `PATCH`, and that is the API telling the truth about what
 * happens: the editor submits the whole state of both lists and it becomes the
 * whole state. There is nothing to merge into, because there is nothing else
 * governing the entry — no rule to inherit from, no level above. What is sent
 * is what a reader is matched against on the next request.
 *
 * Workspace-scoped, so an entry id from another workspace cannot be written
 * through a session that holds this one.
