 * The authenticated app shell: a collapsible left {@link AppSidebar} beside a

 * as the single guarded layout for every non-public route, so it appears only
 * for signed-in users.
 *
 * The sidebar is offcanvas — collapsing slides it away entirely so the content
 * takes the full width; a floating {@link SidebarToggle} (fixed top-left, no
 * layout space) reveals it. `SidebarProvider` owns the open/collapsed state
 * (cookie-persisted, ⌘B toggles); `SidebarContentProvider` lets a descendant
 * route take over the sidebar's contextual region (the workspace shell injects
 * its per-workspace nav there).
 *
 * `PageChromeProvider` owns the other two page-fillable regions: the top bar's
 * trailing **actions** and the **right panel** ({@link AppRightPanel}) — both
 * filled by portal from the page that owns them, so their content keeps that
 * page's context.
 *
 * A "Skip to main content" link is the first focusable element (WCAG 2.4.1
 * Bypass Blocks) — visually hidden until focused, it jumps keyboard users past
 * the sidebar to the `<main id="main-content">` landmark.

 *
 * What it needs from it is the narrow-viewport right panel's state. Under `md`
 * that panel is not a column but a fixed overlay over the whole page, and it had
 * no focus containment: tabbing from inside it walked out through the covered
 * page — still fully interactive, merely hidden — and wrapped around to the skip
 * link. A screen-reader user reading linearly got the page behind the overlay
 * with no indication that anything was on top of it (`ORT-154`).
 *
 * It is contained by making everything underneath `inert` while it is up, not by
 * converting the panel to a `Sheet`: a Sheet unmounts its content when closed,
 * and the panel's body is a **portal host** that has to stay mounted or
 * collapsing it would throw away the filler's state and refetch its data — which
 * this package's `AGENTS.md` states as an invariant. `inert` is the one remedy
 * that leaves that invariant alone.
 *
 * The sidebar is not in the list because on a phone it is a Radix `Sheet`:
 * either closed and unmounted, or open with a focus trap of its own.
