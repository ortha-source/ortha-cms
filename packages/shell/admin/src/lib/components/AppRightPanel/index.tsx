/**
 * The shell's **right panel** — the column beside the main inset that a page
 * fills through `RightPanelPortal` (the entry editor's Properties). It owns the
 * chrome only: a header aligned to the page's top bar (same `h-12` + bottom
 * border, so the two read as one band) over an independently scrolling body.
 *
 * The body host is **always mounted**, even with no panel registered and while
 * one is collapsed — a portal needs its target to exist, and keeping it mounted
 * means collapsing the panel never unmounts the filler, throwing away its state
 * and refetching its data. When there is nothing to show the column is zero-width
 * and `inert`, so it takes no space and leaves the accessibility tree.
 *
 * Collapsed, the control that brings it back lives in the top bar (`PageActions`)
 * — the panel can't offer it while it has no width to draw in.
 *
 * It **slides**, on the app sidebar's timing and curve (300ms, ease-in-out). The mechanism is the
 * sidebar's too: the column animates its width while the panel inside keeps its
 * own, so the panel slides out of the clip instead of re-wrapping its contents
 * on every frame. (The sidebar spells this as a `fixed` panel moved by `left`
 * beside a width-animated gap; a right-edge column can just narrow, because its
 * right edge is already pinned to the viewport.)
 *
 * The transition is **gated on `panel.animate`**, which only the toggle arms —
 * so the panel does not slide in on first paint, or each time a page registers
 * one. Motion here means "you just did that", nothing else.
 *
 * **On a phone it overlays instead of taking a column**: a 22rem column would
 * leave the content nothing. It slides in from the right edge over a scrim that
 * dismisses it, and it starts collapsed there regardless of the desktop
 * preference (see `readOpen`).
