/**
 * The periodic sweep, tested where it is reachable.
 *
 * `AlarmSweepService` is deliberately **not** exported from the package index —
 * it is armed by the module and nothing outside calls it — so a server-e2e test
 * cannot get hold of an instance without widening the production surface for the
 * benefit of a test. Everything the invariants claim about it is about
 * scheduling rather than about content, and all three claims are visible with a
 * stubbed evaluator: whether two rules overlap, whether a second `sweep()`
 * starts a second pass, and whether shutdown waits.
 *
 * The evaluator is gated rather than merely counted. A pass that ran its rules
 * with `Promise.all` and one that ran them in order produce the *same* call
 * count and the same final state; the only thing that separates them is whether
 * the second rule started while the first was still in flight, which needs a
 * rescan that does not finish until the test says so.
