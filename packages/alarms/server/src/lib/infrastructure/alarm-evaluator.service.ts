/**
 * Runs rules against content.
 *
 * Every path through this class ends in the same place — `EntryMatchQuery`,
 * content's own filter evaluation — so a rule means exactly what the records
 * list means by the same filter. What differs between the paths is only *which
 * rows* are examined:
 *
 * | trigger              | examined                                      |
 * | -------------------- | --------------------------------------------- |
 * | an entry was written | that entry, against every rule of its type    |
 * | an entry went live   | ...plus the entries whose rules traverse to it |
 * | a rescan             | the whole collection, against one rule        |
 *
 * The middle row is the non-obvious one and the reason findings close by
 * themselves. "This published article links to a draft author" is a fact about
 * the *article*, but the event that fixes it arrives about the **author**. So
 * publishing an author re-evaluates the articles whose rules traverse an author
 * relation — the same rule, ANDed with `author.id = <the author>`, which is
 * expressible because the stored filter is a tree we can compose rather than a
 * string we would have to re-parse.
