/**
 * How one entry event is routed — and in particular the one distinction the
 * server-e2e suite cannot draw.
 *
 * `entry.deleted` **resolves** an entry's findings and `entry.purged`
 * **deletes** them, and through the findings API the two look identical: either
 * way the finding stops appearing in the default list. The difference only
 * shows up on a restore, months later, when the history that `firstSeenAt`
 * carries is either still there or is not. Here the two store methods are
 * distinct calls, so "a soft delete is reversible, a purge is not" is a claim
 * about which one was made rather than about what a list happens to omit.
