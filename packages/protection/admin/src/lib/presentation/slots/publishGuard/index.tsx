/**
 * What protection tells the entry editor's publish button.
 *
 * A **hook**, per `ENTRY_PUBLISH_GUARD_SLOT`: it is called unconditionally in
 * slot order on every render of `EntryActions`, so it may hold state — which is
 * what lets the bypass dialog's open flag live here rather than in content.
 *
 * **It answers for the version Publish will actually ship.** Publish saves
 * whatever is unsaved first, and on a create form it creates the entry — both
 * write a version no approval is bound to, authored by the person pressing it.
 * So there are three reads, and each comes computed from the server's kernel:
 * the stored head's verdict for a clean editor, `afterSave` for a dirty one, and
 * the type's new-entry verdict for a create form. Reading only the head made the
 * button offer an ordinary publish that the API then refused.
 *
 * Where an administrator may bypass, the button stays an ordinary **Publish**
 * and the click opens the dialog; the dialog's reason goes back through the
 * editor's own publish, so the edits on screen are saved with it.
 *
 * It returns `null` — no opinion — whenever protection has nothing to say: a
 * non-publishable type, an unprotected one, and while the read is still in
 * flight or has failed. That last one matters: a guard that blocked on a failed
 * read would make an unreachable API look like a refused publish, and the person
 * could not tell the two apart. The server refuses the publish regardless, with
 * the reason, so the honest client-side default is silence.
