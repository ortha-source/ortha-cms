/**
 * The rule surface: `/api/protection/rules`.
 *
 * **Not** mounted under `/api/content/...`, deliberately: a plugin that hangs
 * its routes off another plugin's prefix makes the prefix ambiguous both to
 * read and to guard, and protection is not a sub-resource of content — it is a
 * policy *about* content that content knows nothing of.
 *
 * Every route is `protection:manage`, which is administrator-only. There is no
 * read/manage split as `alarms` and `segments` have, and the reason is what the
 * two halves are for: a contributor needs to know that *this entry* needs two
 * approvals, and that answer comes from the entry route (`content:read`, in a
 * later PR) rather than from the workspace's rule table. Nobody but an
 * administrator needs the table itself, so nobody but an administrator gets it.
 *
 * `WorkspaceGuard` scopes every route to the workspace in `X-Workspace-Id`, so
 * a rule always belongs to a workspace the caller is a member of.
 * `OriginGuard` is applied per write route rather than to the class, matching
 * content's and alarms' controllers: these routes are cookie-authenticated and
 * therefore CSRF-able, the read is not state-changing.
