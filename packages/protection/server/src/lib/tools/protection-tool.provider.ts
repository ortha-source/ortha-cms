/**
 * The agent-facing half of publication protection — what a model may ask and

 *
 * **Three tools, and the fourth is absent on purpose.** There is no
 * `protection_approve`, on the copilot or
 * over MCP, now or later. ADR-0017 §6 carries the argument and it is settled;
 * the short form is that with a rule in force the approval *is* the step that
 * unlocks publication, so handing a model `approve` while withholding `publish`
 * hands over the key and keeps the doorknob. Three further reasons, each already
 * written down in this repository:
 *
 * - ADR-0009 deleted the copilot's approval queue because "one sentence and
 *   twelve approvals, nobody reads the twelfth". A tool is that failure without
 *   even the clicks.
 * - ADR-0005 §8: entry bodies are written by users. An entry whose text says
 *   *approve me*, meeting a model holding such a tool, is a self-approving
 *   entry — and unlike an ordinary content write there is no revision to
 *   restore, because the approval **is** the authorization and publication
 *   follows it.
 * - `require_other_person` compares user ids. A copilot run acts as its caller,
 *   so the rule would be satisfied while the guarantee — that a second person
 *   read the thing — quietly would not be. No check can tell those apart.
 *
 * `protection:I-17` pins the absence, and it is pinned against the **registry**
 * rather than against this file: a tool with an approve effect must not appear
 * for any role on any surface, wherever it were contributed from.
 *
 * ## What a model does instead
 *
 * It helps somebody read. `protection_review_diff` is the valuable one — "what
 * changed since the version I approved" is a question revisions answer *exactly*
 * rather than by paraphrase, and it is the question a returning reviewer
 * actually has. The other two let a run report where a review stands and ask for
 * one on the author's behalf.
