/**
 * The protection plugin's module — three tables, one controller.
 *
 * Global, so the rule lookup is injectable from where the publish path is
 * actually guarded: `PublishProtectionGuard` runs inside content's write
 * transaction, not from a route of this package's own.
 *
 * Registered **after** `ContentPlugin`, whose registry and grant query it reads
 * to decide which types a workspace may write a rule for.
 *
 * `forRoot()` takes nothing. The rule table is the whole configuration surface
 * and its empty state is the off state — a plugin that had to be switched on
 * twice, once by the operator and once per workspace, is the settings screen
 * ADR-0009 deleted.
