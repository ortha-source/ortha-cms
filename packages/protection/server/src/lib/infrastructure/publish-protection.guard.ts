/**
 * The publish guard: the third gate, and the one that finally makes a rule mean

 *
 * Registered with `content-server`'s `ContentPublishGuardRegistry`, so it meets
 * **every** caller of the publish path at once — the admin's button, the public
 * REST route, the GraphQL mutation and the MCP tool, which all funnel through
 * the same use-cases. That single reach is the entire argument for a port
 * instead of a patch: there is no list of callers to keep up to date, and a
 * route added tomorrow is covered the day it is written.
 *
 * ## What it does not do
 *
 * It never looks at a field value. Whether the entry is *complete* is the
 * publish gate's question and it has already been answered by the time this
 * runs — which is also why a bypass here cannot publish an incomplete entry:
 * the gate refused before the guard was consulted.
 *
 * It never counts votes itself. Every number comes from `evaluateProtection`,
 * the same function the entry panel reads its "1 of 2" from, so the button and
 * the refusal cannot disagree.
