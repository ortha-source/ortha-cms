/**
 * The domain events the protection context raises.
 *
 * Two families, and they take different subjects on purpose.
 *
 * The **`review.*`** kinds are facts about an *entry* — who asked for it to be
 * looked at, who said yes, who said not yet. They belong in that entry's own
 * history beside its edits and its publishes, because that is where somebody
 * asking "why has this not gone out" actually looks. `segments` keys its
 * `entry_access_changed` event the same way and for the same reason.
 *
 * **`protection.rule_changed`** is a fact about the *rule*. Switching a rule
 * off, or lowering the number it demands, is the quiet way past it: without a
 * row, the bypass is not a button somebody had to justify but a settings tab
 * left open for two minutes. `alarm.rule.updated` exists for the same reason —
 * a disabled rule looks exactly like a rule that finds nothing.
 *
 * **`entry.publish_bypassed`** is the third shape and the one an auditor opens
 * the log for. It is keyed to the entry like the `review.*` kinds — somebody
 * asking "how did this go out without approval" is looking at the record, not
 * at a log of protection's internals — and it is the only kind here raised by
 * something other than a route: the publish guard returns it, and content
 * commits it with the status change, so the row that excuses a publish cannot
 * outlive or be lost by the publish it excused.
