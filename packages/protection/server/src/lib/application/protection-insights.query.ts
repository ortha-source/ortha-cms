/**
 * The Insights card's two figures: how much review is outstanding, and how much
 * of it has been outstanding too long.
 *
 * **One query, not two.** The overdue set is a subset of the open set, so a
 * `filter` aggregate decides both from the same scan — the same reason content's
 * `unshipped` reads its three counts out of one grouped query rather than three
 * `countOf` calls.
 *
 * **No `?days=` window**, deliberately, and for the reason content's `unshipped`
 * takes none: a request that has been waiting a fortnight is waiting whether it
 * was asked this morning or last spring. Windowing it would answer a different
 * question under the same name, and a dashboard figure is believed.
 *
 * The threshold travels **with** the numbers rather than being restated in the
 * admin, so the card's caption cannot come to say "3 days" over a figure counted
 * against something else.
