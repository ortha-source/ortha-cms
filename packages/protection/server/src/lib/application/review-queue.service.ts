 * It exists because without it approvals are possible and nobody knows they are
 * wanted. Until the mail port lands (ORT-207) this page is the *only* way a
 * reviewer learns there is work, which is why it is a page of its own rather
 * than a saved view of one collection's records list — a saved view can only
 * ever ask about the collection it belongs to.
 *
 * The counts beside each line are a hint, not a verdict. The entry route runs
 * the full decision; this one shows "1 of 2" so a reviewer can tell a queue of
 * nearly-done work from a queue of untouched work, and it deliberately stops
 * short of `requireOtherPerson` — applying it here would mean a rule lookup and
 * an author comparison per line for a column nothing gates on.
