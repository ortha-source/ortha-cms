/**
 * Where each of a page's entries stands, in **three queries whatever the page
 * holds**.
 *
 * This is the read behind the records column, and the shape of it is the whole
 * point: a column asking the single-entry review route per row would be an N+1
 * over a page of twenty-five, and the page size is the user's to choose. The
 * three reads are the head revisions (one, through content's batched
 * `RevisionStore.heads`), every vote on those entries (one, over the
 * denormalised `entry_id`), and the workspace's rules (one, and the rule set is
 * one row per protected type — small enough to read whole rather than per row).
 *
 * `review-status-batching.spec.ts` pins the count flat, and it is that test
 * rather than this comment that keeps it true.
 *
 * **It counts through the kernel.** `countApprovals` is the same function
 * `evaluateProtection` calls, so the number in the column is the number the
 * publish gate obeys. Counting here instead would agree until somebody switched
 * on `countStaleApprovals` or the four-eyes exclusion bit — the second
 * implementation #257 was amended to remove, and the reason #260's panel reads
 * the server rather than tallying votes itself.
