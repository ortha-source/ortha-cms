/**
 * Public API of `@orthacms/protection-server` — the publication-protection
 * plugin.
 *
 * A per-content-type rule requiring N approvals before an entry may be
 * published. This package owns the three tables and the rule surface; the
 * **decision** those rules feed is `evaluateProtection` in
 * `@orthacms/protection-domain`, and it is re-exported nowhere here — a
 * consumer that needs it depends on the kernel, which needs no framework.
 *
 * Registering the plugin changes nothing on its own: with no rule written,
 * publication behaves byte for byte as it does with the plugin uninstalled.
