/**
 * `GET /api/insights/i18n/coverage` — how much of the workspace's localized
 * content exists in each configured locale, and how many records are fully
 * translated, untranslated, or part-way.
 *
 * Mounted under `insights/` beside content's and media's widgets rather than
 * under this plugin's own `i18n/` prefix: the Insights page's endpoints are
 * grouped by what they are, and a reader looking for the card's data should
 * find it next to the other cards'.
 *
 * Gated on `content:read` — it counts content, and a reader who may not see
 * entries must not learn how many there are by counting the gaps. Takes no
 * `?days=`: an untranslated record is untranslated regardless of when it was
 * written, so a window could only hide part of the backlog.
