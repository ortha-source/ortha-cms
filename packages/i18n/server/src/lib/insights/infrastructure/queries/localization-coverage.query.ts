 * happen to appear in the data but not which ones are missing — and "missing"
 * is the entire widget. `LocaleRegistryService` is the source of that set, and

 *
 * Like content's own insights query this aggregates **on demand**, per type,
 * with no projection: a localized collection is its own generated
