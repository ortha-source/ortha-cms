/**
 * The i18n plugin's binding of content-server's `CONTENT_ENTRY_EXTENSION`

 * stays locale-agnostic:
 *
 * - **List scoping** — the active-locale filter (strict; the default locale
 *   when the request names none), plus the relation picker's
 *   `localeFallback=default` union.
 * - **Create stamping** — validates the requested slug and stamps the
 *   `locale` envelope column (the group id comes from the column default: a
 *   plain create starts its own translation group).
 * - **Shared-field sync** — on update, non-`localized` field values propagate
 *   to every sibling row of the translation group, inside the same
 *   transaction; published siblings are re-validated so a draft edit can
 *   never silently invalidate live content. The rewritten siblings are handed
 *   back to the entries pipeline, which appends a **revision** for each — their
 *   values changed, so their history has to say so.
 * - **Virtual filters** — `hasLocale` / `missingLocale` / `localeCount`,
 *   resolved to EXISTS / count subqueries over the group (ridden by the
 *   `(locale_group_id, locale)` unique index).
 *
 * Every method no-ops for non-i18n types, as the port contract requires.

     * A translation is created through the ordinary create route with a

     * are join-backed (never in the values bag) or per-locale (deliberately

     * row). So without this a translation is born with none of the record's
     * links, which is exactly the manual per-locale re-linking this sync
     * exists to remove.
     *
     * The donor is one existing sibling — any of them agree on a shared link,
     * and a mirrored one resolves through the same translation group whichever
     * is asked — picked deterministically (the default locale where the group
     * has it) so two creates never inherit from different rows.
     *
     * Columns it derives are also written back onto `row` **in place**: the
     * caller snapshots that object as the new entry's first revision *after*
     * this call, so a database-only write would leave version 1 describing
     * something the row never held.
