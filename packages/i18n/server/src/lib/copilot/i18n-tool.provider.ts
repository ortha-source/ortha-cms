 * The configured locale slugs are deployment config, not content, so nothing
 * else tells the model they exist: without this it either omits `locale` and
 * silently searches the default, or guesses a slug and gets a tool error. One
 * cheap call replaces both failure modes.
 *
 * `getTranslations` answers the question a localized CMS is actually asked —
 * "which languages is this in, and which is missing?" — from the same
 * `LocaleGroupService` the admin's locale panel reads, so the answer can't
 * drift from what the editor shows.
