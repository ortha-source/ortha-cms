 * Authenticates an MCP request and resolves the workspace it acts in, yielding

 *
 * **The same credential and the same rules as `/api/v1/*`** — deliberately, and
 * to the letter. MCP is a second front door onto the content API, not a second
 * security model: it takes the bearer tokens the admin's API Tokens page
 * already mints, resolves them through the same `ApiTokenService.verify`, and
 * derives permissions through the same `scopePermissions`. An operator revoking
 * a token revokes its MCP access in the same instant, and there is no second
 * credential store to audit.
 *
 * This class is the MCP counterpart of three guards that cannot be reused
 * directly, because Nest gates *routes* and MCP is one route carrying many
 * operations:
 *
 * - `ApiTokenGuard` → {@link authenticate}'s bearer half.
 * - `ApiTokenWorkspaceGuard` → {@link authenticate}'s workspace half, rule for
 *   rule.
 * - The per-route `@RequirePermissions(...)` → `ToolDefinition.requires`,
 *   enforced centrally by `ToolRegistry.call`.
 *
 * A **session cookie is not accepted**, exactly as on `/api/v1/*`. Cookies ride
 * along ambiently, which is what makes cookie-authenticated writes CSRF-able; a
 * bearer token never does. Accepting both here would reintroduce that on an
 * endpoint whose whole purpose is letting an agent write content.
