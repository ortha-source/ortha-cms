 * The two claims this package makes about *itself* rather than about anything
 * it does — and which are therefore invisible to every test that drives it.
 *
 * A second table appearing here, or a `domain/` folder, breaks nothing an e2e
 * run can observe: the pool would still open, the outbox would still drain,
 * every route would still answer. The dossier is explicit that both would be a
 * change of architectural decision rather than a routine edit — "a `domain/`
 * folder appearing here would mean the subject area had leaked into the
 * infrastructure, and it should be reverted". The only observable is the source
 * tree, so this reads it, the same way
 * `packages/activity/server/src/lib/package-shape.spec.ts` does.
 *
 * Every scan below is guarded against reading nothing: a walk that finds no
 * files, or a pattern a refactor has defeated, fails here rather than passing
 * vacuously.
