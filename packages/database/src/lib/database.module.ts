 * a style choice. `DatabaseModule` carries a bare `@Module({})` as well as its
 * `forRoot()` dynamic form, so a plugin that writes `imports: [DatabaseModule]`
 * — `copilot/server` does, deliberately, to document the dependency — gives the
 * container a **second** host for the same class. A lifecycle hook on the class
 * then fires once per host, and released the pool twice for one shutdown. A
 * provider lives only in the dynamic module, so there is exactly one per app.

     * shipped server (it exits immediately and Postgres reaps the backends) and
     * a real leak for a host that **embeds** `createServer` and keeps running,
     * which is why `createServer` hands the application back at all.
     *
     * `releaseDatabase`, not `getPool().end()` and not `closeDatabase()`. Not
     * `end()` because ending the pool without clearing the memo leaves
     * `initDatabase` returning early with an ended pool, and every query after
     * it throws "Cannot use a pool after calling end on the pool". Not
     * `closeDatabase()` because the pool is a **process singleton**: a second
     * application in the same process shares the first's, so an unconditional
     * close here ends the database underneath an app that is still answering.
     *
     * `onApplicationShutdown` rather than `onModuleDestroy`, and the ordering
     * is load-bearing: Nest runs every `onModuleDestroy` first, so
     * {@link OutboxDispatcher} gets to finish its in-flight drain before the
     * connections underneath it are taken away.
