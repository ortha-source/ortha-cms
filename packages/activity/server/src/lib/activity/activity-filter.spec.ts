 *
 * The e2e suite pins that an unknown `?filter=` field is a 400 and that the
 * search is case-insensitive. Neither of those can see the two clauses here: a
 * schema that quietly gained `meta` would answer 200 rather than 400 and no
 * existing test would notice, and an unescaped `%` behaves like a wildcard,
 * which on a substring search is invisible — `%` matches everything and a
 * search for it returns rows, just not the right ones.
 *
 * The predicate is read by rendering it with Drizzle's own dialect, so what is
 * asserted is the parameter Postgres would receive rather than a shape this
 * test invented.
