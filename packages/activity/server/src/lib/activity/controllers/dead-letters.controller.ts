 * `GET /api/activity/dead-letters` — the events that should have been recorded

 *
 * **This is the gap-in-the-trail route, and it belongs here rather than
 * anywhere else.** A parked outbox row is an event no subscriber accepted after
 * {@link MAX_DELIVERY_ATTEMPTS} tries, and the subscriber it was most often
 * bound for is this plugin's: an audit row. The dispatcher already logs the
 * moment one parks — but a log line is loud only to somebody tailing logs right
 * then, and afterwards "is anything stuck, and why" had no answer short of a
 * `psql` session. A hole in an audit trail that is only visible to a person who
 * thinks to go looking is barely a hole that has been noticed.
 *
 * Gated on `activity:read`, the same key as the log itself: the question "what
 * is missing from the trail" is the same question as "what is in it", and the
 * answer names event kinds and aggregate ids.
 *
 * It reports rather than repairs. Replaying a parked row means clearing its
 * `attempts` — a deliberate operator action against a fixed cause, not a button
 * that re-runs whatever failed fifteen times.
