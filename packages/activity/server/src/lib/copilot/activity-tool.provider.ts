/**
 * The activity plugin's contribution to the copilot's tool catalogue —
 * `activity.recent`, a thin wrapper over the same `ActivityService.list` the
 * read route calls.
 *
 * **This tool is deployment-wide, not workspace-scoped, and that is not an
 * oversight.** `activity_events` has no workspace column: the trail records
 * user invites, role changes and workspace lifecycle alongside content edits,
 * and several of those events belong to no workspace at all. So there is
 * nothing to scope by, and the tool says so in its description rather than
 * implying a boundary it cannot enforce.
 *
 * What bounds it instead is `activity:read`, which the v1 role matrix grants to
 * **admins only** — the same key guarding `GET /api/activity`. The capability
 * profile withholds the tool from everyone else at *offer* time, so a viewer's
 * or contributor's run is never told it exists (ADR-0005 §3). An admin asking
 * their copilot about the audit log reads exactly what they could already read
 * by opening the Activity page.
