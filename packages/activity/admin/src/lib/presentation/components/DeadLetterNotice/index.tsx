 * Says, on the page whose whole job is being the record of record, that the
 * record has holes in it.
 *
 * An event that exhausted its delivery attempts is very often an audit row that
 * was never written. The dispatcher logs the moment one parks, but a log line is
 * loud only to somebody tailing logs right then — afterwards the question "is
 * anything missing from this log" had no answer short of a `psql` session, and
 * a gap only visible to a person who thinks to go looking is barely a gap that
 * has been noticed. This is that answer, in front of the reader who cares.
 *
 * **Renders nothing when there is nothing to say**, which is the normal case:
 * no placeholder, no "0 problems" row, no reserved space. It also renders
 * nothing while loading or on error — a caveat about a list must never be the
 * reason the page looks broken, and a failed *warning* is not itself news.
