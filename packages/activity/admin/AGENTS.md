# @orthacms/activity-admin

The audit-log **admin plugin**: the global **Activity Log** page at `/activity`,
its sidebar nav entry, and the home dashboard's recent-activity panel. Mirrors
the Members page patterns.

## Layout — layered (ADR-0003), read-only — no domain layer

This plugin is **layered (tactical DDD)**, but it is a **read-only projection
viewer**: it has **no mutations** and **no client-side domain rules**, so — per
ADR-0003 ("don't force DDD on CRUD / read-side contexts") — it has **no
`domain/` layer**. Adding empty `domain/` folders here would be a *violation* of
ADR-0003, not compliance. This mirrors `activity/server`, which is likewise a
read-side/CRUD audit context with **no aggregate**. `src/lib` is organized into
three layers plus a shared type kernel:

- **`infrastructure/`** — the `ActivityGateway` **port** + its
  `httpActivityGateway` implementation (the **one place `apiClient` is used** in
  this plugin, normalizing failures to `ApiError` via `toApiError`),
  `activityMapper` (the wire→view anti-corruption layer, formerly
  `utils/toActivityEvent`), and `activityKeys` (the query-key factory +
  `ActivityListParams`).
- **`application/`** — the `useActivityLog` TanStack Query hook. It calls the
  gateway (`httpActivityGateway.list`), never `apiClient`. Its name and
  signature are unchanged (the barrel + `users-admin`'s user-activity tab
  consume it).
- **`presentation/`** — the pages, components, the `activityPlugin` factory,
  `activityFilterFields`, and `activityMessages`. Consumes the view models +
  the hook only; **nothing here imports `apiClient`**.
- **`types/`** — the wire-independent **view-model contract** shared by the
  mapper (infra) and the presentation: `activityEvent` (`ActivityEvent` /
  `ActivityActor` / `ActivityList` / `ActivityMeta`) and `activityKinds` (the
  `ActivityKind` union the admin restates locally, since it can't import the
  server plugins). Kept as a top-level kernel — not under `presentation/` — so
  the infrastructure mapper can produce these types without depending on the
  presentation layer.

## What it owns

- The private `/activity` route (lazy + `<Suspense>`), rendered in the shell's
  authenticated layout.
- A `SIDEBAR_NAV_SLOT` entry (`group: 'overview'`, `order: 20`) carrying
  `permission: 'activity:read'`, so the entry is **hidden** for users who lack
  it (the shell's `SidebarNavButton` honors the optional `permission` field).
  The page itself also gates on `useHasPermission('activity:read')`.
- A `HOME_SECTION_SLOT` panel (`RecentActivityPanel`) — the latest events on the
  home dashboard, reusing `useActivityLog` and gated on `activity:read`.
- An `ENTRY_SIDEBAR_WIDGET_SLOT` block (`EntryActivityWidget`) — **one entry's
  own trail**, in the content editor's Properties rail. It reads a different
  route (`GET /activity/entries/:id`) under a different permission
  (`content:read`), which is the whole point: the editor's built-in History tab
  is the *revision* timeline — what the words were at each save — and cannot say
  who published the record, who took it down, or who changed who may read it.
  Those rows existed and were reachable only from the admin-only Activity page,
  so the person most likely to ask was the one who could not.
- A `DeadLetterNotice` on the Activity page — how many events could **not** be
  recorded (`GET /activity/dead-letters`). It renders nothing when there are
  none, and nothing while loading or on error: a caveat about a list must never
  be the reason the page looks broken.

## The page

`ActivityLogPage` — `Container`/`ContainerHeader`, a filter toolbar (action/kind
select + actor-email search), the **When · Actor · Action · Subject** table with
**expandable rows** (a leading toggle reveals a details panel — subject, actor,
exact time, raw metadata — animated via a grid-rows `0fr↔1fr` transition,
`aria-hidden` + `inert` on the whole detail `<tr>` when collapsed, reduced-motion
aware), pagination, and a loading **skeleton** (`ActivityLogSkeleton`, used for
both the lazy fallback and `isPending`) plus empty/error/no-access states. The
**URL query string is the source of truth** for every filter and page
(deep-linkable); `page` is clamped to `pageCount` after a filter narrows the
result, and `pageSize` is clamped to the largest option the server accepts.

## Three things about this page that are load-bearing

**The log is deployment-wide, and the copy must say so.** This page sends no
workspace context, and the subtitle and empty state must keep saying "this
deployment": telling an admin of a multi-workspace deployment that the figure is
scoped, on the page whose whole job is being the record of record, is the defect
that copy exists to prevent.

`activity_events` **does** now carry a nullable `workspace_id`, and
`GET /activity` accepts a `workspaceId` filter — so a workspace filter is
buildable where it once was not. It is deliberately not built: the trail records
invites, role changes, sign-in failures and workspace lifecycle alongside
content edits, several of those belong to no workspace at all, and a filter that
silently drops them from a page called Activity would be worse than the absence
of one. If it is ever added it has to say what it excludes. It is **not** a
scoping boundary either way — `activity:read` still is.

**`ACTIVITY_KINDS` must stay in step with the server, and nothing enforces it at
runtime.** The admin restates the kind strings locally because it cannot import
the server plugins. A kind the server writes and this list omits is not a type
error and not a runtime error: the mapper casts `dto.kind as ActivityKind`,
`formatActivityAction` finds no descriptor, and the Action column silently prints
the raw dotted wire token. Six `workspace.*` kinds, `user.activated`, all seven
`media.*` kinds and all three `user.sso_*` kinds shipped that way.

Three things now guard it, and the third is the one that was missing:

- Inside the package, `ACTION_MESSAGES` is typed `Record<ActivityKind, …>`, so a
  kind added to the list without a label is a **compile error**.
- `apps/admin-e2e/src/activity/activity-kinds.spec.ts` proves every kind
  actually **renders** — **update its `ALL_KINDS_ACTIVITY` seed when the server
  gains a kind.**
- `audit-event-mapping.spec.ts`'s "the admin catalogue" block (in
  `activity/server`) compares this list with the server's `AUDIT_KINDS` in both
  directions, so a kind the server can write and the admin cannot render is a
  failing test. **The e2e suite alone could never catch that** — its seed is
  written from this same list, so it proves the list is self-consistent and
  nothing more. That is precisely how the SSO kinds shipped with every test
  green.

The same applies to `ACTIVITY_SUBJECT_TYPES`.

**Keep `types/activityKinds` free of imports.** The server-side check reads that
file as text rather than importing it, because an import would put this React
package in the audit plugin's TypeScript project graph. Two bare `as const`
arrays is what makes that work; if the module ever needs an import, move both
lists into a shared package rather than dropping the check.

**`at` may be an `Invalid Date`, on purpose.** `toActivityEvent` will not
substitute an instant for a timestamp the wire got wrong — inventing one for an
audit row is exactly the silently-rewriting mapper fallback to avoid. The cost is
that `Date.prototype.toISOString` **throws** on the result, and calling it
unguarded in render once blanked the entire SPA (there is no error boundary above
the home slots). Every `<time datetime>` in this plugin therefore goes through
`presentation/activityDateTime`, and every visible date through
`intl.formatDate`, which is total.

## Conventions

- Every module is a `<name>/index.ts(x)` folder, grouped by layer (ADR-0003):
  the gateway/mapper/keys in `infrastructure/`, the query hook in
  `application/`, pages/components/plugin/filter-fields/messages in
  `presentation/`, and the shared view types in `types/` (`camelCase` for
  non-components).
- `presentation/pages/` stays **flat** — only `pages/<Page>/index.tsx`, never
  child component folders. Every component lives under `presentation/components/`.
  A component used only by **another component** nests inside that parent's
  folder (the cells `ActivityActionCell`/`ActivityActorCell`/`ActivitySubjectCell`
  under `components/ActivityTable/`); a component a **page** uses sits at the
  **top level** of `components/` (`ActivityTable`, `ActivityToolbar`,
  `ActivityPagination`, `ActivityEmpty`, `ActivityNoAccess`, and the shared
  `ActivityLogSkeleton`, consumed by both the page's `isPending` body and the
  lazy route's `Suspense` fallback).
- Data flows through the gateway seam: `application/useActivityLog` calls
  `httpActivityGateway` behind the `ActivityGateway` port (the sole `apiClient`
  user), never `apiClient` directly; wire→view mapping lives in
  `infrastructure/activityMapper`.
- `types/activityKinds` restates the kind strings **and** the subject types
  locally (the admin can't import the server plugins);
  `presentation/activityMessages` maps a kind → an "Action" label, a subject type
  → a readable name, and `meta` → a "Details" string — **no hardcoded action
  strings**, no central contract package. Details summaries read **one**
  descriptive field per kind rather than assuming a shared `meta` shape: media's
  payloads differ per kind by design, and the expanded row's Metadata line always
  shows the whole record anyway.
- Co-located `defineMessages` (ids `activity.<area>.<key>`); `type` over
  `interface`; design-system primitives only; a11y per the `accessibility` skill.

## Commands

- `npx nx typecheck @orthacms/activity-admin` / `npx nx lint @orthacms/activity-admin`
- `npx nx test @orthacms/activity-admin` — the unit suite. `testEnvironment: 'node'`
  and `testMatch` is `*.spec.ts` only, matching `alarms-admin` / `copilot-admin`:
  what is tested here is the **pure** part — the mapper's refusal to invent a
  timestamp, the `<time datetime>` guard, and `ACTION_MESSAGES` against
  `ACTIVITY_KINDS`. Rendering belongs in `admin-e2e`, which drives a real browser.
- `npx nx e2e admin-e2e -- --project=chromium` — exercises `/activity` in a browser.
