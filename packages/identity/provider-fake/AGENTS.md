# @orthacms/identity-provider-fake

A **scripted identity provider**: no network, no tenant, no clock skew, the same
answer every run.

**Shipped, not test scaffolding.** It stands on the same footing as
`@orthacms/copilot-provider-fake` (ADR-0004 §3, and ADR-0012 by the same
argument): it is how `apps/server-e2e` drives the *entire* SSO redirect
handshake in CI, and how a contributor exercises the sign-in page with no
identity provider to hand. A deployment that registers it gets a working SSO
button that signs in whoever the composition root scripted.

## It really verifies

The temptation with a fake is a stub that always says yes. That would make the
conformance kit vacuous on the one adapter that runs in every CI job, so this
one does the real shape of the work:

- `authorize` scripts a response and **signs** it;
- `complete` re-derives that signature, checks `state`, checks that the echoed
  `nonce` is the one the core stored, and decodes the subject.

Each check raises its own `SsoVerificationError`, so the kit's rejection
scenarios exercise distinct code paths rather than one shared `throw`.

**The signature covers `code` and `state`, never the nonce.** That is what lets
a replayed-nonce scenario be told apart from a tampered one: change the nonce
and the signature still verifies, so the refusal comes from the nonce check that
is actually under test.

It also puts the PKCE **challenge** in the authorization URL and never the
verifier — the conformance kit checks exactly that, so including the challenge
is what makes the check meaningful.

## Driving it

```typescript
const idp = createFakeSsoProvider({
    users: [
        { subject: 'idp-ada', email: 'ada@example.com', name: 'Ada' },
        { subject: 'idp-grace', email: 'grace@example.com', emailVerified: false }
    ]
});

idp.signInAs('idp-grace');        // who the NEXT authorize hands back
idp.failNextVerification();       // the next complete refuses, once
idp.calls();                      // { authorize, complete } — assert none was made
```

`signInAs` throws for a subject the provider was not configured with, so a typo
in a suite fails where it was written rather than as a puzzling verification
error one call later.

## Package

- Name: `@orthacms/identity-provider-fake`
- Import: `import { createFakeSsoProvider } from '@orthacms/identity-provider-fake'`
- Depends only on `@orthacms/identity-domain` (the port) and `node:crypto`.
