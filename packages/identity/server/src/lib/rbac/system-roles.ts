/**
 * The three built-in roles and their grants — the §4.2 matrix verbatim.
 * Admin holds the full enumerated set (no wildcard, by decision): a future
 * permission must be added both to {@link PERMISSIONS} and to admin's grants
 * here.
 *
 * `copilot:use` is granted to **every** role, viewer included
 * ([ADR-0005](../../../../../../docs/adr/0005-copilot-authority-model.md) §10):
 * the copilot has no authority of its own, so a viewer's copilot is
 * *provably* read-only — it can only ever offer the tools that viewer's own
 * permissions already allow. Cost is handled with per-role rate limits rather
 * than by excluding the largest population from the feature.
 *
 * There is **no** `copilot:configure`:
 * [ADR-0009](../../../../../../docs/adr/0009-copilot-applies-directly.md)
 * deleted the per-workspace policy it gated, and the key with it. It is worth
 * naming here because the key outlived its deletion in every existing database
 * — `seedSystemRoles` used to be additive-only, so the `permissions` row and
 * its grant to `admin` persisted and `/auth/me` kept returning 24 keys against
 * the 23 defined above. The seeder now reconciles in both directions, so
 * removing a key from this file removes the grant.
 *
 * `content:export` and `content:import` are separate keys rather than folded
 * into read and create, because they are separate capabilities. Reading the
 * library a page at a time and taking it out of the system in one file — media
 * bytes included — are not the same act, and the second is the one an operator
 * wants to be able to withhold and to audit. So **viewer does not get export**
 * even though a viewer can already read every record: the difference is bulk
 * egress, not access. Import is granted alongside it for contributors, but the
 * use-case additionally requires the ordinary `content:create` /
 * `content:update` for each write it performs, so importing can never do more
 * than the caller could have done by hand.
 *
 * `content:delete` and `media:delete` are granted to contributor: removing the
 * draft that should never have existed, or the wrong upload, is the same
 * editorial act as writing it, and a role that can publish to the world but
 * cannot retract is the more dangerous of the two. Both are audited
 * (`content.entry.deleted` / `media.asset.deleted`), and a paranoid content
 * type deletes to a tombstone that restore undoes — but a non-paranoid entry
 * and an asset's bytes are gone, so this is a real grant, not a reversible one.
 * An operator who wants deletion held back mints a custom role without the two
 * keys; the routes gate on the permission, never on the role.
 *
 * `views:share` gates only **sharing** a saved list view with the workspace,
 * not saving one. Every role can save private views — that is a personal
 * bookmark over content they can already read — but a shared view becomes a
 * navigation item for the whole workspace, which is an editorial decision.
 * Contributors hold it; viewers do not, and are not blocked from anything by
 * its absence.
 *
 * The two `segments:*` keys gate **reader entitlements** — who may read a
 * published entry. `segments:read` is granted to contributor and viewer: an
 * editor who cannot see that an entry is restricted will publish one believing
 * it is public, and the state is already shown in the entry editor.
 * `segments:manage` is **admin-only**: renaming a segment's tags changes who
 * every entry naming it is visible to, which is a configuration decision rather
 * than an editorial one.
 *
 * The two `webhooks:*` keys are **both admin-only**, which is stricter than the
 * read/manage splits above and deliberately so. A webhook endpoint is not
 * scoped to a workspace, it reaches across every workspace it names, and its
 * delivery log records where this installation talks to on the network. That is
 * infrastructure configuration in the same family as an API token, not an
 * editorial surface — so even reading it is withheld from contributors, unlike
 * `alarms:read` or `segments:read`, which describe content an editor is already
 * working on.
 *
 * `protection:manage` is **admin-only**, and has no `protection:read` beside
 * it — the only asymmetry in this catalogue, and deliberate. A publication
 * protection rule is configuration of the same class as `alarms:manage`:
 * turning one on decides who may ship a content type, for everybody. The
 * missing read half is the interesting part. A contributor does need to know
 * that *this entry* wants two approvals, but that answer comes from the entry
 * itself under `content:read`, not from the workspace's rule table — so nobody
 * but an administrator has a reason to read the table, and a key nobody needs
 * is a key that only ever gets granted by accident.
 *
 * `copilot:skills:manage` is **admin-only** for the same class of reason
 * ([ADR-0010](../../../../../../docs/adr/0010-copilot-skills.md)): a skill's
 * instructions are prompt text that runs for every member of the workspace, so
 * authoring one is a configuration decision rather than a content one. Using a
 * skill needs nothing beyond `copilot:use`, which every role holds.
