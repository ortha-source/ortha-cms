 * disabled" invariant and raises `user.password_changed`), persists it, revokes
 * the account's live sessions, and drains the event to the outbox — all in one
 * unit of work.
 *
 * **The revocation is part of the operation, not a nicety.** A session is a
 * bearer credential the old password opened, and it outlives that password by
 * its full TTL: without this, someone changing their password because it was
 * phished or shoulder-surfed would leave every session the attacker already
 * holds signed in for up to a week. Rotating the credential has to evict what
 * the previous credential authorized, and it has to happen in the same
 * transaction as the hash write, or a failure between the two leaves the
 * account in the worst combination — new password, old sessions.
 *
 * `keepSessionId` spares the caller's own session so the common self-service
 * case does not sign the user out of the device they are standing at.
 *
 * The `user.password_changed` event carries the actor, and the activity
 * plugin's audit subscriber turns it into a `user.password_changed` audit row —
 * a credential rotation is exactly the kind of event a security review reads
 * the log for.
 *
 * No HTTP route wires this yet (password reset / self-service change land in a
 * later ticket); it is the aggregate's credential-change flow, ready for that
 * controller.
