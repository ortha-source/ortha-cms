/**
 * Finishes an SSO sign-in: burns the attempt, has the adapter verify the
 * provider's response, resolves the account, and opens a session.
 *
 * **The ordering here is the security design, so it is worth reading as one
 * sequence:**
 *
 * 1. The attempt is found by the browser's cookie. No cookie, no attempt, and
 *    no amount of correct-looking response parameters substitutes for one.
 * 2. `state` is compared **before** anything is exchanged, so a forged callback
 *    costs one indexed lookup rather than a round trip to the provider.
 * 3. The attempt is **burned before the exchange**, not after. Burning
 *    afterwards would let a replayed callback drive a second token exchange
 *    before the first finished; burning first means a replay finds nothing.
 *    The cost is that a network failure during the exchange strands the attempt
 *    and the person clicks the button again — the right trade.
 * 4. The exchange itself runs **outside any transaction**. It is a call to a
 *    third party, and holding a write transaction across one is how a slow
 *    identity provider turns into database contention. Same reasoning as
 *    `ResetPasswordUseCase` keeping bcrypt out of its transaction.
 * 5. Only then does one unit of work resolve the account, create or refresh the
 *    link, open the session and append the event — so a link can never outlive
 *    a sign-in that failed. A link that survived a failed sign-in would grant
 *    the *next* attempt a path that skips the verified-email check entirely.
 *
 * **What it will not do (this phase).** It signs in accounts that already
 * exist. It creates none, and it changes nobody's role. Ortha is invite-only by
 * design, and this replaces the credential check rather than the way in.
 *
 * Every failure raises the same {@link SsoLoginFailedError}. The caller is
 * anonymous and the identity provider is not: told apart, these failures would
 * let anyone who can authenticate at a public provider discover which addresses
 * hold Ortha accounts.
