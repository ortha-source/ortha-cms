 *

 * turns a `401` into `data === null` (nobody is signed in — the ordinary signed
 * out state), and rethrows everything else. A `500`, a timeout or a dropped
 * connection therefore lands on `unavailable`, not `unauthenticated`, because
 * it tells us nothing about the session. Treating the two alike is what made an

/**
 * Resolves the current user via `GET /api/auth/me` and publishes it into the
 * auth context, so {@link RequireAuth} can gate routes. The shell composes this
 * around `RequireAuth` in its `layout`, so it wraps the private area (not the
 * public sign-in page); the host renders that layout without knowing any of this
 * exists.
 *
 * It also owns the **session-lost** reaction: while mounted it installs the
 * shared client's `401` handler, so a session that dies mid-visit — revoked from
 * another device, expired, or the account suspended by an admin — drops the
 * cached user and lands the visitor on the sign-in page instead of leaving a
 * shell that 401s on every request.
 *
 * And it **says so**, which is the part the redirect alone never did. React
 * Router replaces the whole view with the sign-in page: focus was on a control
 * that no longer exists so the browser resets it to `<body>`, a screen reader's
 * virtual buffer still holds the unmounted page, and anything typed into a form
 * is gone — with no message anywhere explaining why (WCAG 4.1.3 Status
 * Messages, 2.4.3 Focus Order). The toast is a real announcement in the host's
 * live region and survives the route change; the flag it sets is what lets the
 * sign-in page repeat the explanation in a place the visitor can still read
 * after the toast has gone.
 *
 * The transport seam stays meaning-free on purpose — `setUnauthorizedHandler`
 * exists so `utils-admin` does not decide what a `401` means, and that package
 * owns no user-facing strings — so the message belongs here.
