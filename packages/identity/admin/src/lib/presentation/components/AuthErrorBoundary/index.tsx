 * no longer on the server, so the dynamic `import()` behind `/identity/signin`
 * rejects. React propagates that past the `Suspense` fallback — a boundary is
 * the only thing that stops it — and with nothing to catch it the whole app
 * unmounted to a blank white page. On the sign-in route specifically that is as
 * bad as it gets: the user cannot get in, and a blank page offers no hint that
 * reloading is the fix.
 *
 * Deliberately a class component: React still offers no hook equivalent of
 * `componentDidCatch`, and a render-phase throw is exactly what needs catching.
