 * page is safe.
 *
 * Disabled when there is no token at all (a link with no `?token=`), so the
 * page can render its "this link looks broken" state without a pointless
 * request. Retries are off: a `404` here means the link is dead, and retrying a
 * dead link only delays telling the user. Failures that are *not* a `404` say
 * nothing about the token, so the page renders its outage state and hands the
 * retry to the user (`refetch`) rather than looping on their behalf.
