/**
 * The SSO seam's zero-dependency rule, asserted rather than reviewed.
 *
 * Every adapter package — OIDC, SAML, GitHub, and whatever a deployment writes
 * itself — depends on this one to speak the port. A single dependency added
 * here is inherited by all of them and by the server that hosts them, which is
 * how a "framework-free kernel" quietly stops being one. The manifest is the
 * only place that can be checked without a build, so it is the place to check.
