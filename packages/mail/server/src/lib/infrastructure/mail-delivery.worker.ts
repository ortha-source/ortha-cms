/**
 * Hands queued messages to the provider.
 *
 * **The one structural rule:** the claim runs in a transaction, the hand-off
 * does not. `MailDeliveryRepository.claim` opens a short transaction, leases a
 * batch and commits; only then does this worker talk to a mail server. A relay
 * that takes the full timeout therefore costs one message's progress, not a
 * held pool client — the rule ADR-0016 exists for, which this plugin keeps even
 * though its enqueue deliberately breaks that record's *shape*.
 *
 * Messages in one batch are handed over **serially**. Twenty parallel
 * connections to one relay is the behaviour that gets a sender rate-limited,
 * and the retry schedule's jitter exists precisely so a backlog does not come
 * back as a burst.
