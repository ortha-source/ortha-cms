 * Compiles the server with the app's `tsc` and, unless told otherwise, builds

 *
 * **Deliberately not bundled.** Every Ortha plugin locates its migrations as
 * `join(__dirname, '../../../migrations')`, which resolves to its own package
 * root inside `node_modules` — and stops resolving the moment a bundler
 * flattens those files into one. The monorepo's `apps/server` gets away with
 * webpack only because it must inline packages it consumes from source; an
 * installed app has no such problem, so it leaves `node_modules` alone.
