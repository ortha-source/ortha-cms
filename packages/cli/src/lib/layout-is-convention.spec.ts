/**
 * The application layout is a **convention**, and `LAYOUT` is where the whole
 * convention is written down.
 *
 * The invariant has two halves and they are not equally reachable. "`LAYOUT`,
 * not configuration" is checkable, because a path has to be spelled out
 * somewhere to be used: a second opinion about where the server compiles to is
 * a string literal, and this file is the assertion that there is no such
 * literal outside the one table. The other half — "the CLI reads no settings
 * file of its own" — is an unbounded absence over the package, and stays
 * recorded as the missing clause in `docs/coverage/judgments/cli.json`.
 *
 * What the checkable half buys is not tidiness. Every one of these paths is
 * load-bearing at a distance: `serverEntry` follows from `apps/server/
 * tsconfig.json`'s `rootDir`, and a copy that drifted would have `ortha start`
 * report a missing entry point for an app that had built perfectly.
