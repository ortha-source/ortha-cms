/**
 * Builds the streaming request body for an already-resolved `model`.
 *
 * **No `thinking` configuration is sent**, deliberately. On current models
 * thinking is on by default, and turning it off makes them occasionally write
 * a tool call into the *visible text* instead of emitting a tool-use block —
 * the call then silently never runs, which for a tool-driven copilot is the
 * worst available failure mode. The lever for cheaper runs is `config.effort`.
 *
 * No sampling parameters either: current models reject `temperature`, `top_p`
 * and `top_k` outright, which is why the port never carried them.
 *
 * **Prompt caching is on unless the host turns it off.** A run is a loop, and
 * the API is stateless, so step _n_ resends everything steps 1…_n_−1 already
 * sent — the prompt grows every step while the *new* content is one tool
 * result. Uncached, a run's billed input is roughly quadratic in its step
 * count, which is what made the step ceiling behave like a cost ceiling. Cache
 * reads are ~0.1x base input, so the resent prefix stops dominating and
 * `maxTotalTokens` goes back to measuring new work.
 *
 * Placement follows the API's render order — `tools` → `system` → `messages` —
 * so a single breakpoint at the end of `system` covers the tools with it. That
 * one is the whole static prefix of every step in the run; the rest roll
 * through the conversation ({@link withCacheBreakpoints}).
