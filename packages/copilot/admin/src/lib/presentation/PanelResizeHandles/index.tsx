 * add eight tab stops to a non-modal surface a keyboard user is passing
 * *through* on the way back to the page — which is the whole reason the panel
 * has no focus trap. So the north-west corner is a real `<button>` with arrow
 * keys, and it alone: the panel's home is the bottom-right corner, so growing
 * up and to the left is the direction that has somewhere to go, and one handle
 * that resizes both axes covers what the other seven do between them.
 *
 * The rest carry `aria-hidden`, because a strip that cannot be reached without
 * a pointer and does nothing when it is reached is noise in the accessibility
 * tree, not an affordance.
