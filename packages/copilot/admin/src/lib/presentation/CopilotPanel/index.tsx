 *

 * A `Sheet` is a modal dialog: it dims the page, traps focus, and blocks every
 * control behind it. But the useful thing to do with an answer about your
 * content is *act on it* — open the entry it named, check a field, run the
 * filter it suggested — and a modal makes you close the conversation to do any
 * of that. Docked and non-modal, the panel sits alongside the page: you can
 * scroll the records table, click into an entry, and keep the thread open
 * beside it.
 *
 * Consequences of being non-modal, all deliberate:
 * - **No focus trap.** Tab moves out of the panel and into the page, which is
 *   correct — the page is still live.
 * - **No overlay**, so nothing behind it is dimmed or click-blocked.
 * - Focus is still *managed*: the composer takes focus on open, and closing
 *   returns focus to whatever opened it rather than dropping it on `<body>`.
 * - Escape closes it, matching what every floating panel does.

 * user cannot is a window whose position is a mouse-only setting; arrow keys
 * move it, `Shift` moves it faster, and the header's Expand button puts it
 * back.
 *
 * It doubles as the visual cue that the header is grabbable, which the cursor
 * alone only tells you after you have already hovered it.
