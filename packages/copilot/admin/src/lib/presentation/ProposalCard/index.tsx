/**
 * One change the copilot made, with its per-field diff — **a receipt**.
 *
 * It used to be the accept boundary: two buttons, and a decision that had not
 * been taken yet.
 * [ADR-0009](../../../../../../docs/adr/0009-copilot-applies-directly.md)
 * removed the human step, so by the time this renders the write has already
 * happened (or failed). Every word on it is past tense for that reason — a card
 * that still read "Needs your approval" would be describing a step that no
 * longer exists.
 *
 * **Its job is unchanged even though its buttons are gone: be unmistakable
 * about what happened.** With nothing pausing for review, this card is the only
 * place a user learns that their content changed — so "Saved" and "Not saved"
 * are stated in words, not implied by styling, and a failure shows the server's
 * own reason rather than a generic apology.
 *
 * The card lives in the transcript, attached to the turn that produced it,
 * because a change is part of an answer: "here is what I changed". A list
 * elsewhere would make the reply refer to something off-screen, and the reply
 * is where the reasoning is.
