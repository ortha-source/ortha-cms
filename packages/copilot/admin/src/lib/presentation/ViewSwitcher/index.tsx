 * out is wherever they happen to remember. A segmented control that is on screen
 * in *both* modes says there are two of them and which one you are in, and
 * costs one click either way.
 *
 * Going back to the CMS returns you to **the page you left**, not to the
 * workspace's default section. Someone who breaks off mid-way through an entry
 * to ask a question should not have to navigate back to it, and the round trip
 * is the whole reason both surfaces exist.
 *
 * It renders in the sidebar's contextual region — **above**
 * `CurrentWorkspaceProvider`, like every other section there — so it resolves the
 * open workspace from the route rather than from context. Nothing renders
 * outside a workspace or without `copilot:use`.
