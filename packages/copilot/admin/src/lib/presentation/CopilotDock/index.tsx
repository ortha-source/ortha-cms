/**
 * The bar along the bottom: one pill per chat, plus a way to start another.
 *
 * **It replaces the floating button**, and is the reason there can be more than
 * one chat at all. A single round button could only ever mean "the panel";
 * a bar of chats means the panel is one of several, and gives a collapsed chat
 * somewhere to live where you can still see it exists.
 *
 * Three things it has to get right:
 *
 * - **A pill for a chat you cannot see must say something happened in it.**
 *   That is the entire point of running several: you ask three questions and go
 *   back to work. The marker is a dot, and it is also in the pill's accessible
 *   name — a colour-only signal is no signal for a screen-reader user, and this
 *   one is load-bearing.
 * - **Clicking a pill toggles**, so the same control that shows a chat hides it
 *   again. `aria-pressed` says which state it is in rather than the styling
 *   alone.
 * - **Close is a separate control with its own name.** "Close Fix the headline"
 *   rather than an unlabelled ×, because closing ends a run and discards a
 *   window, and it sits a few pixels from the thing that merely hides it.
 *
 * Bottom-**right**, not full width: it sits where the floating button was, and
 * a bar spanning the viewport would cover page content across every screen for
 * the sake of at most a handful of chats.
