# @orthacms/copilot-admin

The admin-side copilot plugin — **two surfaces onto one chat**.

> **The product is called Ortha AI; this package is called `copilot`.** Every
> `defaultMessage` a user reads says "Ortha AI"; the message **ids**, component
> names, routes and permission keys all keep `copilot`. Deliberate — see the
> naming note at the top of
> [`docs/design/copilot.md`](../../../docs/design/copilot.md). When you add a
> string, follow the same split.

- **The docked panel**, from the shell's `SIDEBAR_FOOTER_SLOT` (or `⌘J`). The
  slot renders **nothing into the sidebar** — it is only what mounts the
  component, which portals the dock and its windows to `<body>`. A chat is a
  window over whatever page you are on, which is the point of it being a
  persistent surface rather than a destination, and there can be **several at
  once**, listed in a bar along the bottom right.
- **The Agents view**, a full page inside the workspace at
  `/workspaces/:id/agents` — history as a column, the transcript with the width
  to render a table or a diff. See [Agents view](#the-agents-view) below.

Both render the _same_ transcript, composer, tool steps, permission prompts and
change cards. Two chat surfaces that diverge is two chat surfaces to keep
correct.

It contributes **no top-level route and no global nav entry**. Runs are
workspace-scoped (`X-Workspace-Id` is required by `WorkspaceGuard`), so
everything here lives strictly inside a workspace: the page and the switcher go
into the workspace shell's own `WORKSPACE_ROUTE_SLOT` / `WORKSPACE_SECTION_SLOT`,
and the launcher renders nothing outside one. There _was_ a top-level route once,
for the workspace's auto-apply policy;
[ADR-0009](../../../docs/adr/0009-copilot-applies-directly.md) deleted the
policy along with the screen, the table, the two routes and `copilot:configure`.
What the copilot may do is what the caller's role may do, so there is nothing
left to configure per workspace.

## Decisions worth knowing

- **The transport is `fetch`, not the shared `apiClient`.** Axios cannot stream a
  response in the browser. `streamRun` replicates the two behaviours that matter
  — `credentials: 'include'` for the httpOnly session cookie, and the
  `X-Workspace-Id` header — rather than changing `apiClient`. It is SSE over
  **POST**, because the turn has a body and `EventSource` can only issue a
  bodyless GET. (Verified to stream unbuffered through the Vite dev proxy.)
- **`useCurrentWorkspace()` is unusable here, and fails loudly.**
  `CurrentWorkspaceProvider` wraps only the workspace shell's _inset content_;
  the app sidebar — where the launcher lives — renders **outside** it, and the
  hook **throws** there rather than returning null, taking the whole admin down
  on every page. `useRouteContext` reads the URL instead; the
  sidebar is still inside the router. The id only ever becomes
  `X-Workspace-Id`, which `WorkspaceGuard` validates for shape and membership,
  so a route-derived id is no more trusted than a context-derived one.
- **A pure reducer, not `setState` in the stream loop.** A `text-delta` arrives
  dozens of times per answer and must append to the _current_ last message, not
  a stale closure's. Keeping it pure also makes the interesting cases — a step
  resolving, a run erroring mid-answer — unit-testable without a socket.
- **The dock is the only entry point to the _panel_.** It replaced the floating
  button, and then the sidebar row went too. A round button could only ever mean
  "the panel", singular; a sidebar row duplicated what the dock already says
  while spending a permanent navigation slot on it. With no chats open the dock
  _is_ a labelled Ortha AI button in the corner — carrying the shortcut hint,
  which is where the shortcut is now discoverable — and as soon as there are
  chats it becomes the bar listing them. The hint's glyph is **derived from the
  platform** (`domain/shortcut.ts`): it was the literal `⌘J` everywhere, telling
  every Windows and Linux reader to press a key they do not have, on the one
  affordance whose whole job is to teach the shortcut. That button's accessible
  name also **contains its visible label** ("Ortha AI — new chat"): it was the
  constant "New chat", so the two had nothing in common and "click Ortha AI" did
  not work by voice (2.5.3). The Agents view is reached the other way, through
  the sidebar's `ViewSwitcher`, and the dock's button stands down while you are
  on it.
- **The window is non-modal, not a `Sheet`.** A modal drawer
  dims the page, traps focus and blocks every control behind it — but the useful
  thing to do with an answer is act on it, which would mean closing the
  conversation first. Consequences, all deliberate: no focus trap (Tab leaves
  the panel, because the page is live), no overlay, focus still _managed_
  (composer on open, the dock's new-chat button when a window **closes or
  collapses** — the panel always had the return-focus machinery and was never
  handed the ref, so minimizing dropped focus on `<body>` and the next Tab
  restarted from the top of the document). The window is named by its own
  `<h2>`, i.e. the thread's title: a constant `aria-label` made every open
  window one indistinguishable "Ortha AI" in a screen reader's dialog list.
  **Escape collapses to the dock rather than closing** — discarding a chat and
  cancelling its run is too much to hang off the key people press to dismiss
  things, and the chat keeps streaming as a pill.
- **Markdown is rendered by a small local component**, not a dependency. It
  covers what an assistant actually emits — including **pipe tables**, which was
  the first gap real use hit and hit hard: without them a content-type table
  fell through to the paragraph branch, which joins lines with a space and
  collapsed the whole thing into one run-on line. The parser is split into
  `parseBlocks.ts` so those cases are unit-tested without rendering. The
  load-bearing property is that it builds **React elements and never touches
  `dangerouslySetInnerHTML`**, so escaping is automatic — an answer is derived
  from content the model read, which is user-authored and
  attacker-influenceable. Link hrefs are additionally scheme-allow-listed, since
  escaping does not save you from `[click](javascript:…)`. **If a second gap
  like the table one turns up, stop growing this and take `react-markdown`** —
  it is a drop-in replacement for the component.

## The Agents view

A page at `/workspaces/:id/agents`, contributed to the workspace shell's
`WORKSPACE_ROUTE_SLOT` at `order: 50` — a **high** order on purpose, so the
Content Library (10) stays what `/workspaces/:id` lands on. Three columns: the
app sidebar's workspace nav, the thread rail, the conversation.

**The third column is the point.** Keeping the CMS navigation on screen is what
makes leaving the Agents view one click on something already visible, rather than
a hunt for the way back. The `ViewSwitcher` — a two-segment CMS / Agents control
at the top of the workspace sidebar, `WORKSPACE_SECTION_SLOT` at `order: 5` — is
the two-way control, and going back to the CMS returns you to **the page you
left** (remembered per workspace in `sessionStorage`), not to the workspace's
default section. Someone who breaks off mid-entry to ask a question should not
have to navigate back to it; that round trip is the whole reason both surfaces
exist.

Why a page at all, when the panel exists: the panel is for a question _about the
page you are on_, and it is deliberately small and non-modal. The page is for the
work where the conversation _is_ the task — a long thread, a change to read
carefully, something you asked yesterday. History is a column instead of a
dropdown, and a content-type table or a diff gets the width it needs.

### The URL is the thread

`/…/agents` is an unsaved new chat; `/…/agents/:conversationId` is that thread.
Deep-linkable, reload-safe, and navigable with the browser's own Back button.
Four things about how that is wired are load-bearing:

- **The id is read from the location, not from a nested `<Route>`.** The first
  turn of a new chat mints a thread id and rewrites the URL from the base to the
  thread path — with two route elements React Router would unmount one and mount
  the other **mid-stream**, aborting the very run that produced the id. One
  always-mounted component reading `readAgentThreadId(pathname)` has no such
  seam. Same reason `useCopilotChat` is called once per page and the transcript
  is swapped underneath it, rather than keying a component by thread.
- **Load, clear and adopt are one effect, and the last two are told apart by
  whether the URL just changed.** All three are guarded on `urlId`, and the two
  obvious formulations are both wrong:
    - guarding adoption on "the chat's id differs from the URL's" breaks
      _switching_: clicking another thread while an answer streams makes them
      differ, so the URL gets shoved back to the running chat and the user's own
      navigation is undone. When the URL names a thread, the URL is the
      authority.
    - splitting clear and adopt into two effects breaks _New chat_: both run in
      the same commit, so the adopt effect still reads the **pre-reset**
      conversation id — a state update lands on the next render, not inside the
      effect that asked for it — decides the URL is missing an id, and navigates
      straight back into the thread you just left.

    Hence one effect and a `lastUrlIdRef`: the URL _changed_ to the base means New
    chat (clear); the URL was _already_ the base and an id appeared means the first
    turn started (adopt).

- **Opening a thread is a query here, a mutation in the panel.** A mutation's
  per-call `onSuccess` runs only while the component that called `mutate` is
  still mounted, and this load is kicked off by an effect — React's StrictMode
  remount alone was enough to swallow the callback and strand the page on its
  skeleton for good. The query is disabled the moment the chat is already on the
  thread, which also stops a new chat from fetching back the conversation it is
  streaming into. Read `isFetching`, never `isPending`: a disabled query is
  "pending" forever.
- **Switching threads parks the one you leave; it no longer stops it.** The
  chat goes back to the dock as a live pill (see the store, below). While it
  _did_ stop, it exposed a latent bug in `useCopilotChat` that is still fixed
  and still worth having: `abort()` is not instantaneous, so the run loop checks
  that its own `AbortController` is the current one before dispatching each
  frame, and its `catch`/`finally` are guarded the same way — otherwise a
  cancelled answer appends itself to whichever conversation replaced it.

### The rail

**A row is its name and nothing else.** It carried a timestamp under the title
once; it was true and it was noise, because the group heading above already says
Today / Yesterday / Previous 7 days — the second line spent half the row's height
restating the section it sat in. Dropping it halves the row, which is what makes
twice as many conversations scannable at a glance, and scanning is the only thing
this list is for. Hierarchy carries the selection rather than an accent bar: an
inactive row is muted, the open one is solid on a filled ground, `aria-current`
announces it, and the weight changes too.

The group headings use the full `text-muted-foreground`, **not** an opacity of
it. `/80` at 10px is a serious contrast failure, and the admin-e2e axe scan is
what says so — the token is the one that was verified against AA, so tinting it
further is undoing that check by hand.

`groupConversations` buckets threads by **calendar day**, not by elapsed
milliseconds — a thread from 11pm last night is _yesterday_ at 1am, not "today",
and normalising through a UTC midnight of each local date keeps the DST
transition out of it. Empty buckets are dropped: a "Yesterday" heading with
nothing under it reads as a loading failure. The filter appears only past five
threads (a search box over three rows is furniture that pushes the rows it
searches down the rail), and an **untitled thread matches nothing but the empty
query** — the title is the only text the list route carries.

The rail is a `md:` column; below that it is the same `AgentsRailList` inside a
sheet, opened from the top bar's **Chats** button. Both render it, which is why
that component navigates and holds no chat state: which thread is open is a fact
about the URL.

### Renaming and archiving

Each row carries a `⋯` menu — **Rename…** and **Archive** (or **Unarchive**) —
revealed on hover _or focus_, and positioned over the title rather than in a
column of its own: a permanent second column would truncate every title in an
18rem rail to make room for a control most rows never need.

**There is no Delete, and that is a product decision rather than a gap.** A
thread's proposals are the receipts for changes actually made to your content, so
destroying a conversation destroys the only record the user has of those edits.
Archiving is reversible, keeps the transcript, and is the part people actually
want. See the server package's AGENTS.md for what a hard delete would have to
answer for.

- **The archived list is a mode, not a route.** A footer link switches the rail
  to it, and it appears only once something has been archived — a permanent
  "Archived (0)" is a door to an empty room. It is local state rather than a URL
  param on purpose: Back already moves between threads, and stepping through a
  filter with it would fight that.
- **Archiving the thread you are reading starts a new chat.** Otherwise you are
  left looking at a conversation that is in no visible list.
- **Invalidate `conversationsScopeKey`, never `conversationsKey`.** Every write
  here moves a thread _between_ the two lists, and `conversationsKey(id)`
  defaults `archived` to `false`, so it is the exact key of the active list and
  nothing else — invalidating with it refreshes the list you are looking at and
  leaves the other stale. This was a real bug: archiving worked, and the
  "Archived" link never appeared.
- **Renaming is a dialog, and its focus return is hand-wired.** The dialog is
  opened _from a menu item_, which unmounts with its menu — so Radix has nothing
  to restore focus to and drops it on `<body>`. The row hands up a callback that
  focuses its own menu button, and the dialog calls it from `onCloseAutoFocus`
  with the default prevented. The callback lives in a **ref**, not in state:
  closing clears the dialog's state in the same commit that unmounts it, so a
  callback held in state is already gone when Radix asks for it. Both halves
  were found by driving it, and neither is visible in a screenshot.
- **Save is disabled while saving, never on a validation error.** A greyed-out
  Save refuses without saying why, and on a field the user has not blurred there
  is no message on screen either; submitting an invalid name is what surfaces
  the reason. The field also carries no `maxLength`, so a pasted title too long
  gets an explanation instead of a silent truncation.

### The empty state has a honeycomb behind it

`HoneycombBackdrop` — an SVG lattice of large hexagons in `text-border`, the
same hairline grey as every divider in the admin, masked by a radial fade centred
above the greeting. **Not the brand orange**, which is what it was first: a
lattice covering the whole panel plus an orange hexagon mark and an orange card
hover is far more surface than a single accent is meant to carry, and the empty
state read as a different product from the rest of the admin. **And the mark is
gone entirely** — it was one more thing to read before the question it sat on
top of, and the lattice already carries the motif. The greeting is the first
thing on the screen. A honeycomb because
it is what the surface _is_: a workspace's content is a lattice of small things
that fit together. Three things keep it a backdrop rather than decoration:

- **Big cells.** At half the size it tiled into texture — legible as pattern but
  not as hexagons, which is the difference between a backdrop and a shade of
  grey.
- **The fade ends before the cards do.** It haloes the greeting and has
  dissolved by the time the suggestions start, so they sit on clean ground.
  Tuned by looking at it; the first pass reached them and the panel read as graph
  paper.
- **`currentColor` off a token class**, so it follows the theme instead of being
  a light-mode flourish that turns into scratches on the dark canvas.

The pattern ids come from `useId()`: two of these can be on screen at once, and
duplicate SVG ids make the second reference the first's pattern.

### One bar, not two

`AgentsTopBar` composes the design-system `TopBar` directly, the way
`ContentTopBar` does, instead of a `PageTopBar` plus a header of the thread's
own — that pairing would spend 6rem of a chat surface on chrome. Rendering a real
`TopBar` also matters beyond looks: it is what hosts the sidebar-reveal trigger
when the app sidebar is collapsed, and what makes the shell's floating fallback
toggle stand down. It hoists itself into the inset's fixed strip, so it spans the
rail and the thread both and neither scrolls under it.

### A run keeps going when you leave

Start an answer on the Agents view, navigate to the CMS, and the chat becomes a
**dock pill that is still streaming**. When it lands, the pill says "finished"
and the browser tab shows `(1)`. Come back to that thread from the rail and the
page takes it over again, answer and all.

- **The mechanism is `copilotStore`, not a second copy of anything.** Chats live
  in module state, so no component owns one and unmounting cancels nothing. The
  page _presents_ a chat (`presented: 'page'`); the dock draws neither a window
  nor a pill for it, because it is already on screen and larger than either.
- **`release` decides what survives.** A chat with an answer in flight, or one
  parked on a permission prompt, becomes a pill; **anything else is closed.**
  Keeping every thread you glanced at would fill the dock with conversations you
  merely read — and they are persisted server-side and one click away in the
  rail, so nothing is lost.
- **A chat handed back is a pill, never a window.** A window popping open over
  the page you just navigated to is the surface following you around.
- **The base path still means a new chat.** Going to the Agents view does not
  hoover up whatever is in the dock; opening the _thread_ (from the rail) does,
  and that is the affordance for "put this back on the big screen".
- **The markers were already right.** `unread` is only ever set on a chat that
  is off screen and `awaiting` is live state, so the dock pill and the tab badge
  needed no new rules — just a chat that is still there to report them. Whoever
  is mounted does the reporting: the page while it presents, `CopilotSession`
  once the dock has it back.
- **The ceiling is the tab, and that is not a shortcut.** The server treats a
  client disconnect as an abort (`stopReason: 'aborted'`), so a run cannot
  outlive the page that started it. Surviving a reload or a closed tab needs the
  server to keep the run detached and replay frames on reconnect — plus sticky
  routing, since the permission broker is in-memory. Different, much larger
  feature.

### The tab badge

`(2) Ortha CMS` on the title, and a dot on the favicon, for chats that want you
back — `unread` or `awaiting`, counted **once** per chat. Deliberately no
`Notification.requestPermission()`: it is the only thing that reaches someone who
has switched application, and it costs a prompt you get one chance at, so it is a
product decision rather than a default.

- **The base title is captured once**, at mount. Re-reading `document.title` each
  time stacks `(1) (2) Ortha CMS` — there is a test for it.
- **The favicon is best-effort.** If the icon cannot be drawn (no `<link
rel=icon>`, a format the canvas refuses, a cross-origin taint) the dot is
  skipped and the title still carries the count. Degrading to the title alone is
  fine; blanking someone's favicon is not.

### The dock stands down here — the bar only

On the Agents view the dock's button offers to open the page you are already on,
so it is not rendered. **Only the bar**: every `CopilotSession` stays mounted
regardless, because unmounting one is what cancels its run, and navigating
between two copilot surfaces must never be a disguised Stop. If chats _are_
already open their pills stay, since they are windows that have to remain
reachable.

## Several chats at once

Ask three things, go back to work, come back when the dock says one finished.
That is the feature; everything below is what it costs.

- **Chat state lives in `copilotStore`, outside React.** It used to live in
  `CopilotSession`, one level above the panel, because a hook inside an
  unmounting panel took its `AbortController` cleanup with it — so minimizing
  was a disguised cancel. That fix only ever moved the problem: the Agents page
  hit the same wall one level up, where the unmounting thing was the _route_.
  Now nothing owns a chat. Components are views, and **cancelling is something
  you do — closing a chat — never something that happens to you because a route
  changed.**
- **The window cap minimizes rather than refuses.** Three windows fit side by
  side on a 1440px screen without covering the content the chat is _about_ —
  which is why the panel is non-modal in the first place. A fourth minimizes the
  oldest visible chat, which keeps running. Refusing would be the wrong trade:
  the user asked for another chat, and the one they stopped looking at is the
  cheapest thing to give up.
- **Two markers, and they mean different things.** `unread` — a run finished —
  is edge-triggered off `busy` going true→false and only ever set on a chat that
  is **off screen**. `awaiting` — the run is parked on a permission prompt — is
  live **state**, set even while visible, and outranks `unread` on the pill:
  a chat blocked on a question is the one to open first.
- **The `awaiting` action returns the same array when nothing changed**, so
  `useReducer` bails out. That is load-bearing: it is reported from an effect
  whose callback is a fresh closure each render, and an action that always
  allocated produced "Maximum update depth exceeded" — found by driving it in a
  browser, not by reading it.
- The `unread` marker is edge-triggered off `busy` going true→false. Watching the transcript
  instead would fire on the first `text-delta`, i.e. before there is anything to
  come back and read; badging the window the user is already reading trains them
  to ignore the badge that means something.
- **The marker is in the pill's accessible name, not only in the dot.** A
  colour-only signal is no signal, and this one is the entire point of the
  feature.
- **An untitled pill is "Untitled chat", never "New chat".** That is the name of
  the button beside it, and two controls in one group answering to the same
  name is ambiguous by voice and in a screen reader's control list. (Caught by
  the browser harness, not by review.)
- **The bar is a `group`, not a `toolbar`.** It was a toolbar, for the good
  reason that a screen reader then announces one control group rather than a
  loose row of buttons floating over the page — but per the WAI-ARIA APG a
  toolbar is a _composite_ widget: one tab stop, arrow keys inside it. This has
  neither a roving tabindex nor an arrow-key handler, so the role promised a
  keyboard model that does not exist and told a screen-reader user to press keys
  that do nothing. Every pill is its own tab stop (`2N + 1` for N chats), which
  is what `group` describes. Implementing the roving tabindex instead would be a
  fine future change; declaring the role without it is not.
- **Reopening a thread focuses the window already on it — from _both_ paths.**
  Two windows on one `conversationId` hold two transcripts of one server-side
  conversation, and they disagree from the next turn onwards: the one that sent
  it grows, the other silently goes stale while still offering a composer that
  appends to the same thread. The sessions reducer's `open` has always refused
  it and the Agents rail goes through it; **the panel's history dropdown did
  not** — it called `chat.load` directly. It now asks first (`onAdoptConversation`),
  and carries the thread's **stored title** while it is there, which is why a
  thread opened from the dropdown used to be labelled with its opening question
  rather than the name the rail shows for it. The match is on the id, so two
  _unsaved_ chats (both `null`) stay separate.
- **A window's remembered geometry is keyed by slot, not by chat.** A chat is
  ephemeral; "the leftmost window" is a place on the screen the user arranged.
  `usePanelFrame` reads its key through a ref so a window changing slot cannot
  write its geometry under the old slot's key and swap two windows' positions.

## Asking before a write

A write tool the thread has not already allowed parks the run, and the prompt
renders **in the transcript** — not as a modal. The panel is non-modal on
purpose (you act on answers while reading them), and a dialog demanding an
answer would block the very page you need in order to decide, often the entry
the change is about.

- **Focus moves to the prompt's primary button when it appears.** The panel
  stays non-modal — nothing is trapped and Tab still leaves — but this is the
  one control that stops a prompt-injected write before anything happens
  (ADR-0009 §1b), and it was reachable only by tabbing _backwards_ from the
  composer, past the model picker and the paperclip, into a scroller that is
  still moving. Its only announcement path was the transcript's `role="log"`,
  which is saturated by the answer still streaming. A consent control the user
  cannot find is one that gets answered blind or not at all. The arguments
  `<pre>` is the group's `aria-describedby` and is itself focusable, because it
  scrolls.
- **Three buttons, no "always".** Once / this chat / don't allow. "For this
  chat" is the escape hatch, and having it _in the prompt_ is the whole
  difference from the settings page ADR-0009 deleted — you decide where you
  already have the context, not in advance on another screen.
- **A 404 from the answer is expected traffic**, not a bug: the run's five-minute
  timeout fired, or it is parked on another instance. The prompt then **keeps its
  buttons** and says the answer did not land — the run might still be parked, and
  taking the controls away would strand it.
- **A `tool-result` for a parked call retires its prompt.** The server timing
  out, or another window answering, both end the wait without this client having
  clicked; live buttons that answer nothing are worse than no buttons.
- **"Waiting for you" is session _state_, not an `unread` event** — see the dock
  notes above. A chat asking a question stays asking, so an edge-triggered
  marker missed the ordinary case of parking while visible and being collapsed
  afterwards. That miss was hidden behind an infinite render loop; both are
  fixed by the same change.

## The step list reads as a log

`ToolStep` shows a **phrase in two tenses** — "Searching content…" while it
runs, "Searched content · 12 results" once it has — from `ToolStep/labels.ts`,
keyed by tool name.

It used to show the raw `admin_content_search` beside a separate "Running…".
That is a pending state that technically existed and told nobody anything: a
tool that takes 20ms flashes past, so what a user saw was a list of snake_case
function names appearing already-finished. Two tenses rather than one string
with a spinner is the point — "is happening" and "happened" are different
sentences, and a run that made six calls should read back as six of them.

- **The identifier is still there, one click away**, as a payload row in the
  expanded panel: someone debugging wants it and nobody else has to read it.
- **An unknown tool degrades, it does not blank.** `humanizeToolName` turns
  `mcp.acme.fetch_orders` into "Fetch orders" — the connector namespace is
  plumbing this CMS imposes (ADR-0005 §8), not part of the tool's own name. It
  is deliberately **not** translated: there is no message to translate for an
  identifier a third party chose, and minting an id per unknown tool would put
  untranslated English in the catalogue under a key nothing resolves.
- **A step names the thing it is doing, not only the kind of thing.**
  `toolSubject` pulls a subject out of the call's own arguments — the `summary`
  every `propose` tool's schema asks the model to write _for a person_ first,
  then the query, the title, the content type — so the line reads "Creating an
  entry · German translation of Prescribing Information". It costs no protocol
  change: `tool-call` already carries the arguments and is emitted **before** the
  call runs, and a stored `tool_use` block keeps them, so the live and reopened
  transcripts derive the same subject from one function. The value is
  model-authored text derived from workspace content, so it is treated as
  hostile: control and format characters (bidi overrides included) are stripped,
  every whitespace run collapses, and it is cut on **code points** so a
  truncation cannot split a character. Rendered as a text node, never as markup.
- **The gap between calls says which call it was.** The pending line under a
  streaming turn is chosen by `MessageList/activity.ts` (pure, unit-tested), not
  by a condition in JSX: after a completed step it reads "Searched content —
  working out what to do next…", and "Thinking…" survives only for the gap where
  that genuinely is all anyone can say — before the first frame of the turn. It
  stands down for a running step (which has its own spinner and its own
  present-tense phrase), for prose still arriving (the words _are_ the status),
  for a failed turn, and for an unanswered permission prompt. It used to stand
  down for the **whole turn** as soon as any prose existed, so a turn that
  explained itself, searched, and then thought for three seconds showed a
  finished step and nothing else — the answer looked stuck.
- **A failed apply now draws as a failed step.** The `tool-result` event carried
  `ok: true` with `summary: 'failed'` — a green tick beside the word "failed".
  The block the _model_ gets stays a normal result whose text says NOT applied,
  because that is a receipt to report rather than an error to recover from.

### A plugin can render its own tool's result

`COPILOT_TOOL_RESULT_SLOT` (`presentation/slots/copilotSlots`) takes a
contribution of `{ id, toolName, Component }` and `ToolStep` renders it inside
the expanded panel, **above** the raw payload it would have shown anyway.
`@orthacms/alarms-admin` is the first user: `admin_alarms_findings` comes back as
a list of flagged records, and a list of records is something a person clicks,
not something they read as JSON.

Four rules, and the specs pin all of them:

- **The renderer is resolved only for a step that succeeded and produced
  output.** A running step has nothing to render and a failed one has an error
  the step line already states; handing either to a plugin's component means
  every such component has to re-derive those states for itself.
- **The raw payload stays.** A rich rendering is a convenience over the
  transcript's own receipt, never a replacement for it — someone checking what
  the model actually saw must still be able to.
- **Matching is on the exact tool name.** No prefix, no namespace-stripping: an
  MCP connector's `mcp.acme.admin_alarms_findings` is a third party's tool that
  happens to share a suffix, and rendering it with this workspace's component
  would be a claim about data nobody here produced.
- **A component that cannot read its payload returns `null`.** A transcript is
  replayed from stored history, so a result written by an older build of the
  tool reaches today's renderer; falling through to the payload costs the reader
  nothing, and a throw inside a transcript costs them the conversation.

`toolResultRendererFor` is a plain function over `getItems()`, not a hook —
`ToolStep` calls it inside a render for one name and the slot's contents are
fixed at plugin-registration time, so there is nothing to subscribe to.

## Changes the copilot makes

A `propose` tool's change arrives as its **own** run event, after the tool
result the same call produced. The two answer different questions — the tool
result is what the _model_ was told, the proposal event is what the _human_ is
being shown — so the step list renders from one and the card from the other.

**The card is a receipt, not a decision.** Since ADR-0009 the write has already
happened by the time it renders, so every word on it is past tense and it has no
buttons. That inverts what it is guarding against: it used to exist to stop a
user reading "drafted" as "done", and now exists because it is the _only_ place
they learn their content changed at all.

- **The card lives in the transcript, exactly where the change happened.** A
  turn is an ordered `ChatBlock[]` — prose, tool steps and cards interleaved —
  not three buckets sorted by kind. It _was_ three buckets, and the layout could
  not say when anything occurred: a model that explains, saves, and keeps writing
  produced a card pinned to the bottom while the new text appeared above it, so
  the transcript showed the change happening after the sentences written after
  it. The rule it replaces ("the card renders after the prose") was right about
  the common case and wrong as a layout — chronology gets both.
- **A `text-delta` merges into the newest block only while that block is text.**
  That is the mechanism: a step or a card ends the paragraph, so whatever the
  model writes next starts a new one _below_ it.
- **A reopened thread rebuilds the same order from `content`**, which is the
  model port's block list as the run produced it — so the stored order is the
  order, and each proposal is emitted straight after the `tool_use` that made
  it. Sorting by kind here is what used to strand a card at the bottom of a
  reopened thread too.
- **`ChatBlock` wraps rather than intersects.** `{ kind: 'step' } & ChatToolStep`
  is tidier and silently clobbers `ChatProposal.kind` — the applier that carried
  the change out, `content.entry.update`, which the card renders. The extra
  `.step` / `.proposal` hop is the price of not overwriting a field.
- **`pending` means the apply failed.** Nothing waits any more, so the card
  reads that status as a failure: a destructive badge, "Not saved", and the
  server's own reason. It falls back to a generic line when a reopened row
  carries no message — keyed off the **status**, never off `error` being
  present, or an older row would render its diff as though the change had landed.
- **That failure banner does not use the design system's icon slot.** `Alert`
  positions a top-level `<svg>` absolutely (`left-4 top-4`) and nudges the block
  beside it up 3px — geometry tuned for a _title over a description_. This alert
  is a description alone, usually one line, so those rules put the icon near the
  top of the box and the sentence off its centre. Wrapping the icon and the
  description in a flex row means none of the `[&>svg]` selectors match, which
  fixes it here without changing the geometry the admin's ~25 other alerts are
  drawn with. The wrapper is `py-3`, not `pt-3`: with no bottom padding the
  banner butted into the footer's rule and read as part of the line below it.
  Five other description-only call sites (users, api-tokens) have the same
  alignment defect and are a candidate for a generic `Alert` grid rewrite.
- **Reopening a thread reattaches the cards.** `useOpenConversation` fetches the
  transcript and `GET /copilot/proposals?conversationId=` concurrently and joins
  them on `toolCallId`, which is why the server stores it. The failure reason
  comes back with them.
- Proposed values render as **text**, never markup — same rule as the tool step's
  payload, and for a stronger reason: this card is what tells a human what was
  written to their content.

## The panel is portalled to `<body>` — and must stay that way

This component is contributed to the **sidebar's footer slot**, so without a
portal the fixed-position chrome is a DOM _descendant of the sidebar_ and
inherits its styling. That is not hypothetical: the sidebar sets
`text-sidebar-foreground` (a near-white, for its dark background), so the panel
rendered near-white text on its own white surface at **2.86:1** — well under the
4.5:1 WCAG AA requires, and the first thing anyone using it complained about.

`createPortal(…, document.body)` fixes the whole class of problem (colour, font,
letter-spacing) rather than the one symptom, and stops `position: fixed` ever
being trapped by a transform on an ancestor. React context flows through
portals, so the permission and workspace hooks are unaffected.

The panel additionally states `text-foreground` on its own root: it paints its
own surface, so it should own the colour that goes on it rather than inheriting
one. Measured after the fix: **17.67:1**.

## Surface context

Every turn carries where the user is — workspace, content type, entry, locale —
so the model can resolve "this entry" and "here". It comes from the **URL**
(`readRouteContext`, pure and unit-tested; `useRouteContext` feeds it
`useLocation()`), for the same reason the workspace id does: the launcher lives
in the sidebar, outside `CurrentWorkspaceProvider`, and anything the entry editor
exposed through context would be equally out of reach.

It is **opt-in**: a `+ Add context` button attaches the current page, and the
chip has an `×`. Attaching automatically was the first version and it was wrong
— every question looked like it was about whatever page happened to be open, so
asking "how many authors are there?" from the Articles list told the model you
were looking at articles. The attached value is a **snapshot**, not a live
mirror of the URL; navigating re-offers the button so a stale one can be
replaced without removing it first.

Three things that matter:

- **`new` and `trash` are not entry ids.** They sit in the `:entryId` slot on
  the create form and the trash view. Sending `entryId: "new"` would have the
  model confidently discuss an entry that does not exist.
- **The attached context is shown** (`ContextChip`, above the composer). Context
  attached invisibly is context the user cannot correct when it is wrong. The
  design's turn anatomy asks for it too: "Your message, plus where you are" (§2).
- **What is attached lives on the session**, exactly like the model choice and
  the staged skills — and it was the worst of the three at surviving. It was
  `useState` inside `PanelBody`, which unmounts the instant a window collapses,
  and inside `AgentsThread`, which unmounts on leaving the view. So the ordinary
  sequence — attach the entry, collapse the window to go and read it, come back
  and ask — sent the turn with **no** context, and the chip had gone with it, so
  nothing said so. It is deliberately **not** seeded into the next chat the way
  the model and the skills are: attaching is opt-in per question precisely so a
  question asked from the Articles list is not silently declared to be about
  articles, and an inherited attachment would put that bug back. Switching a
  window to another thread keeps it, because the attachment belongs to the
  question being written rather than to the transcript above it.

None of it is an authority claim. `workspaceId` becomes `X-Workspace-Id`, which
`WorkspaceGuard` validates; `contentType`/`entryId` reach the model as prompt
text, and any tool call made with them is re-checked against the workspace's
grants. A hand-typed URL gets a user nothing they didn't already have.

## Errors: alert, warning, toast

Three presentations, chosen by what the user can actually see and do:

- **A failed turn → `Alert variant="destructive"` in the transcript.** It is the
  record: it stays with the turn it belongs to and survives scrolling. Streamed
  text already received is kept above it — a partial answer is part of what
  happened.
- **A truncated run → `Alert variant="warning"`.** A ceiling is not an error;
  the answer above is real, just cut short. This used to be muted 12px text
  under the answer, which is exactly where "this is incomplete" goes unread. A
  deliberate cancel is neither, and gets a quiet line instead of a banner
  telling the user about their own action. **The reason fragment is a message
  descriptor per stop reason**, not a bare string in a lookup map: it completes
  a translated sentence, so leaving it as a literal meant no extractor could see
  it and no catalogue could ever translate it — the frame localized and the half
  carrying the meaning did not.
- **Stop is the one ending the _client_ has to write for itself.** Every other
  one arrives as a frame; cancelling closes the connection, so the server's
  matching `stopReason: 'aborted'` is recorded on its side and can never reach
  us. And the run loop deliberately bails out of its own `catch` once the
  controller is no longer the chat's current one — which the abort has just made
  true. So `stop()` aborts **and** dispatches `cancelled`; without the second
  half the turn stayed `streaming` forever, `busy` never cleared, and the
  composer's button stayed Stop for the rest of the session. Found by the
  admin-e2e suite, not by reading it.
- **A system condition → `toast.error`, but only while minimized.** The toast
  exists to reach someone who _cannot see_ the alert, and the only such state is
  a minimized panel (a run keeps streaming while it is). Toasting with the panel
  open is worse than useless: the host mounts `Toaster` bottom-right, exactly
  where the panel sits, so it covers the composer to announce something already
  on screen a few pixels above.

`describe()` classifies the throw: an abort is the user's Stop, a
`CopilotRunError` carries the server's own message (with 401 reworded — "your
session has expired" beats "Unauthorized"), and a bare `TypeError` from `fetch`
means the host was unreachable. Only the last two are `systemic`.

**Read panel state through a ref, not the captured value.** `send`'s async
closure is created when the message is sent, but the failure it handles can land
seconds later, by which time the panel may have been minimized — which is the
case the toast is for. Capturing would decide on the state at Enter.

## Moving and resizing

The panel is a window: drag the header to move it, drag any of the eight edge
strips to resize it. Four things about how that is built are load-bearing.

- **A frame is `null` until the user places one.** The docked / expanded /
  minimized geometry stays in CSS, so the panel opens correctly on a viewport it
  has never been opened in, and `left`/`top` remembered from a 4K monitor can
  never be what positions it on a laptop. `usePanelFrame` only takes over
  positioning once someone actually drags, and the first drag **measures**
  `getBoundingClientRect()` so the window does not jump as the gesture starts.
- **Expand and Shrink clear the placement.** They are the way out of a bad drag,
  and the header already has them. Nothing else clears it: the frame survives
  close/reopen and reload (`localStorage`), which is the point of being able to
  move it. The button reads its label off the _preset_, not off `size` — "Shrink"
  on a window the user has just resized to 400px is nonsense.
- **The arithmetic is pure and in `panelFrame.ts`**, because the interesting
  cases are all arithmetic: the whole panel stays on screen (a dragged-off panel
  is a lost panel — there is no other affordance for retrieving it), a saved
  frame on a smaller monitor **slides in rather than shrinking**, and dragging
  the west or north edge past the minimum stops that edge dead instead of towing
  the panel across the screen. That last one is the bug the spec exists for:
  clamping the width _after_ moving `x` moves the whole window.
- **Pointer capture, and no `preventDefault()`.** Capture keeps the moves coming
  when the pointer outruns a 6px strip, and guarantees the release arrives.
  `preventDefault` on the pointerdown would also swallow the focus a mousedown
  gives the resize handle — and that focus is the whole of its keyboard support
  — so text selection is suppressed with `select-none` on the panel instead.

Keyboard: seven strips are pointer-only and `aria-hidden`, because eight
focusable splitters would add eight tab stops to a non-modal surface a keyboard
user is passing _through_. The two that are real controls are the header grip
(arrow keys move, `Shift` for larger steps) and the north-west corner (arrow
keys resize) — the panel's home is bottom-right, so up and left is the direction
that has somewhere to go.

## Motion

Two traps, both hit while building this:

- **`animate-in` / `fade-in-0` / `zoom-in-95` do nothing in this workspace.**
  Those are `tailwindcss-animate` utilities and it is deliberately not
  installed, so the classes shadcn ships generate no CSS at all — see the note
  atop `packages/design-system/src/styles.css`. The panel and the floating
  button use plain **transitions** instead, which is also the safer primitive:
  with motion disabled the element simply lands on its visible state, where a
  keyframe animation can leave it stuck invisible.
- **Transition `translate` and `scale`, not `transform`.** Tailwind v4 emits
  those as standalone CSS properties rather than folding them into the
  `transform` shorthand, so `transition-[opacity,transform]` fades the opacity
  while the movement snaps. It looks subtly broken and reads as a timing bug.

The panel keeps a `rendered`/`visible` state pair so the exit transition can
play before unmounting — and it does still unmount, which is what ends the run.
Both elements carry `motion-reduce:transition-none`.

## Model selection

The picker renders `GET /api/copilot/models` (`ModelRegistry.catalogue()`), and
the choice is **sent per turn** — a conversation can start on a cheap model and
escalate. The picker hides itself when the deployment offers one backend.

**Every row is a real model, and a chat opens on the first one.** There is no
"Default" option and no deployment setting behind it: the server's
`config.defaultProvider` is gone, the first provider `plugins.ts` registers is
the default, and `useEffectiveModelChoice` makes that `items[0]` here. So an
unpicked chat sends `provider`/`model` naming the backend the picker is
showing, rather than omitting them and letting the server decide something the
UI could not name. It is **derived, not seeded**: the catalogue is a query, so
there may be nothing to seed from when a chat opens, and an effect filling it in
later would race the model a saved thread was left on — and a derived value is
also not a _pick_, so nothing is written back to the thread until someone
touches the picker.

**A pick is remembered in three places, and each covers what the one before it
cannot.** Nothing here pins a thread to a model: every turn still carries its
own, and all three exist only because the choice kept being _forgotten_, which
nobody chose.

- **On the session** (`sessions.ts`). Held in `useState` it was lost by
  collapsing a window _and_ by leaving the Agents view — the user picked a model,
  came back, and silently got the default again.
- **In the store's per-tab seed** (`rememberChoice` / `seedChoice`), so a new
  chat inherits the last model _picked_. Someone who always wants the bigger
  model does not re-pick it every time.
- **On the thread** (`copilot_conversations.model_choice`, written through
  `useThreadModelChoice` → `PATCH /copilot/conversations/:id`, read back on
  `ConversationView`). The tab was the ceiling of the other two: reopening a
  saved conversation after a reload, or in a second tab, put you back on the
  house default with nothing on screen to say so.

Three rules keep that from becoming noise, and each is a unit or e2e case:

- **Only a _pick_ is written back.** `CopilotSession.choicePinned` tells a pick
  apart from an inherited seed and from a value **adopted** from the thread
  (`adopt-model`, deliberately not `model`). Without it every new conversation
  would record a decision nobody made, and every thread opened would echo its own
  value straight back.
- **Adopting is not picking**, so it does not touch the per-tab seed either:
  reading an old conversation must not change what your next new chat starts on.
- **`'default'` is a legacy value, read but never written.** It was the third
  state, back when "Default" was a selectable option meaning "whatever the
  resolver picks". Nothing produces it now, and a row still carrying it reads
  back as "nobody picked here" — which lands the chat on `items[0]`, the same
  place a thread with no stored value lands. `storedModelChoice` /
  `readStoredModelChoice` are the whole encoding, and the sentinel stayed
  unambiguous only because a real `<provider>:<model>` key always contains a
  colon.

The PATCH does **not** bump `updatedAt` (the rail sorts by it, and touching a
picker is not using a thread), and the write deliberately invalidates only that
thread's own key — refetching both rails when nothing a rail renders has changed
is two requests for an identical redraw.

**Both surfaces keep the picker inside the composer, bottom-left** — passed as
the `Composer`'s `controls`, which is the slot for anything that acts on the
_next turn_. Its first home on the Agents page was the page's top bar, and that
was the wrong statement: chrome above the transcript reads as a property of the
conversation, and the model is not one. The panel's header row made the same
claim and has since given the picker up too, so the two surfaces now read as one
product; the header keeps the history dropdown alone.

It does fit a 420px panel, and a 320px one (`MIN_PANEL_WIDTH`) — but only
because the picker's trigger is `min-w-0`. The paperclip and the skills button
beside it are both `shrink-0` and both short; a model id is long and is the one
label that survives being abbreviated, so it is the control that gives way and
ellipsizes. Drop that `min-w-0` and the row wraps at the narrow end instead.

## The composer grows

The field starts at two rows and grows with what you type, capped at `MAX_HEIGHT`
(152px, about six lines) after which it scrolls. Two fixed rows is fine for "how
many authors are there?" and wrong for the paragraph of context that makes a
question answerable — you end up editing through a letterbox. Three details are
load-bearing:

- **`useLayoutEffect`, not `useEffect`.** Measuring after paint shows one frame
  at the old height, which reads as a flicker on every keystroke that wraps.
- **Collapse to `auto` before measuring.** `scrollHeight` never reports less than
  the height already set, so without it the field can grow and never shrink.
- **The border and focus ring are on the wrapper**, not the field — the field is
  stripped of both. The controls row is inside that wrapper, so it reads as one
  box; two nested rings on focus is the giveaway that a composer was assembled
  rather than designed.

## Attaching files

A paperclip in the composer, plus drag-and-drop onto the box and paste from the
clipboard. `useComposerAttachments` stages them; the chips render through the
same `AttachmentChip` the transcript uses, because an attachment does not change
once sent and two components would be two chances for staged and sent to drift.

- **The upload goes through `apiClient`, not the run.** It is an ordinary
  `POST /media/assets` on the user's own session with their own `media:create` —
  the same request the Media Library page makes, from a different button. The
  copilot gains no write path, and a user who cannot upload cannot attach.
- **An attachment is a permanent library asset**, not a blob that dies with the
  conversation: findable later by `media_assets_search`, attachable to a content
  record, subject to the same retention as anything else.
- **Uploading happens on add, not on send**, so the wait is spent while the
  person is still typing and a file that will be rejected is rejected before
  they have written a question about it. Send is blocked while any upload is in
  flight — sending then would drop the file from the turn silently, and once the
  message is gone there is no way to tell "attached" from "still uploading".
- **Removing a chip does not delete the asset.** It means "don't send this with
  my message" — the file stays in the library, where the person can delete it
  deliberately if that is what they meant.
- **The run body carries ids only.** The server resolves the name, kind and size
  from the row, because that is the only part it can verify. The optimistic turn
  still renders the full staged refs — the chips were on screen a moment ago,
  and having them vanish until the first frame lands reads as a failed send.
- **`useComposerAttachments` keeps a ref beside its state**, and does its
  arithmetic against the ref. React invokes a `setState` updater twice under
  StrictMode, so counting how many files fit _inside_ one would advance the id
  counter twice per file and pair every upload with the wrong chip.
- **The drag highlight counts enter/leave.** Drag events fire per element, so
  entering a child fires `dragleave` on the parent; without the counter the
  overlay flickers across every child the pointer crosses.
- Paste is intercepted **only when the clipboard carries files** — a normal text
  paste has an empty `files` and must not be swallowed.
- The composer renders no attach control at all when the surface passes no
  `attachments` prop, rather than offering a button that fails — and **both
  surfaces gate that prop on `media:create`** for the same reason. An attachment
  is not a copilot authority: the upload is an ordinary `POST /api/media/assets`
  on the user's own session, and `viewer` holds `copilot:use` but not
  `media:create`, so the paperclip was offered to someone whose every upload
  403s. The skills picker is _not_ gated the same way and must not be: using a
  skill needs nothing beyond `copilot:use`, which every role holds.

**A send refused because a run is still in flight says so.** It used to do
nothing at all — the box correctly kept the text (losing it would be worse) and
nothing said why it had not gone, so someone who had not noticed the button
become Stop read it as a dropped keystroke and pressed Enter again. The notice
goes through the same hint line and clears when the run ends.

**The transcript follows the answer only while the reader is at the bottom.**
The scroll effect fired on every `turns` change unconditionally, and `turns`
changes on every `text-delta` — so scrolling up to re-read an earlier turn while
an answer was arriving yanked you back down on the next token, over and over,
with no way to stay put but to stop the run. Scrolling away is the reader saying
they are reading something else; scrolling back within `FOLLOW_SLACK` of the
bottom is them saying they are done.

The hint line under the box doubles as the live region for this: the count
refusal and the "waiting for uploads" state are both reasons a send did not
happen, which a screen-reader user otherwise meets as silence.

**The staged list is "Files to send"; a sent turn's is "Attached files".** They
had one name to begin with, and two lists in one view answering to the same name
leave a screen-reader user unable to tell a file they are still staging from one
already on its way. The e2e suite found it by resolving the wrong list, which is
the same ambiguity in machine form.

`agents-attachments.spec.ts` covers this surface, and it is the only part of the
feature a browser can answer for: staging, the drag highlight, paste attaching
files while a text paste still pastes text, send blocked mid-upload, removal,
the count refusal, and an axe scan with files staged. Two notes for extending it:
`locator.dispatchEvent('paste', …)` **does not work** — Playwright builds the
event from a name→constructor map with no `ClipboardEvent` in it, so
`clipboardData` is dropped and the handler sees no files; the POM constructs and
dispatches the event inside the page instead. Drop is fine declaratively, since
`DragEvent` _is_ in that map.

## Skills

A skills button beside the paperclip, chips above the field, and a management
page inside the Agents view. The feature is settled in
[ADR-0010](../../../docs/adr/0010-copilot-skills.md) and described in the design
doc's §11; what follows is only what is true of _this_ package.

- **The selection lives on the session, not in the picker** — the same rule the
  model choice already learned, and the same bug: held in `useState` it is lost
  by collapsing a window or leaving the Agents view, and the next turn silently
  runs without the instructions the person set up. Worse than the model case,
  because nothing on screen would say so.
- **It is also seeded into the next chat**, like the model choice, and a browser
  is what settled it: leaving the Agents view **closes** an idle chat
  (`release`), so without the seed a trip into the CMS to check an entry dropped
  the selection entirely. Inheriting into a genuinely new chat is the cost, and
  it is paid for by the chips being on screen the whole time.
- **Sticky across turns, unlike attachments.** A file belongs to the message it
  was attached to; a skill is the mode you are working in. `send` clears
  `files` and deliberately does not clear skills.
- **The composer sends `chosen`, and renders `inForce`.** Two lists, because
  they answer different questions: `inForce` is always-on + staged and is what
  the optimistic turn draws as chips, while `chosen` is only what the person
  picked and is the only thing on the wire. Sending an always-on skill's name
  would be the client asserting a decision the server makes — harmless while it
  is always-on, and wrong the moment an admin switches it to manual.
- **An always-on chip has a lock, not an `×`.** It cannot be taken off here, and
  offering a control that silently does nothing on the next turn is worse than
  offering none.
- **"Skills for this chat" and "Skills used"** — two accessible names, for the
  reason the two file lists have two: one list name across a staged set and a
  sent one leaves a screen-reader user unable to tell them apart.
- **The button carries the count in its accessible name**, and therefore has no
  `aria-label` — one saying "Skills" would override the count with the one thing
  it must not hide. (The e2e suite caught this; a colour-only signal for "this
  run behaves differently" is no signal.)
- **A staged name missing from the catalogue is dropped**, not sent. A skill
  deleted while it sat in someone's composer would otherwise fail their next
  turn with a true and useless sentence; the chip vanishing when the catalogue
  refreshes says the same thing before they press Send.
- **The picker renders nothing when the workspace has no skills** — the same
  discipline as the attach control, rather than a button opening an empty list.
- **The manage page is inside the Agents view** (`agents/skills`), because
  everything the copilot owns is workspace-scoped and it contributes no
  top-level route. Its route is declared **before** the `agents/*` wildcard and
  `readAgentThreadId` excludes the segment explicitly — a belt-and-braces pair,
  since the ranking alone is a fact about React Router rather than about us.
- **The rail's link is permission-gated and fail-closed.** Skills are visible to
  everyone in the picker; authoring is admin-only, so a contributor gets no link
  rather than a page that greets them with "no access".

## When the deployment has the copilot off

`COPILOT_ENABLED=false` unregisters every copilot controller on the server, so
there is nothing here to talk to. The surfaces stand down rather than fail:
`useCopilotAvailable` — the launcher, the `ViewSwitcher`, the Agents page and
the Skills page all read it — reports off, so neither entry point renders and
the two pages, reachable only by a bookmark once the entry points are gone,
draw a "turned off" empty state instead of a screen whose every query 404s.

- **The probe is the model catalogue, not a capability endpoint.** A deployment
  that cannot serve `GET /copilot/models` cannot serve a run either, which is
  the question all four surfaces are asking — and a second endpoint would be a
  second thing to keep in step with the switch.
- **Only an explicit `404` counts as off** (`copilotIsOff`, pure and
  unit-tested). Still loading, a network blip, a `5xx` and a `403` all leave the
  surfaces up: the server refuses regardless, so being wrong this way costs a
  control that answers "not found", while being wrong the other way would make a
  transient failure look like a feature the operator removed.
- **It is only probed for a user who could use it anyway** (`enabled: canUse` /
  `canManage`), so it costs one cached request per session and only for the
  people it can be true for.
- **"Turned off" and "no access" are told apart**, not collapsed into one empty
  state. "Nobody may here" and "you may not" send the reader to different
  people.

## Conventions

Follow the `admin-plugin` skill and
[`packages/bootstrap/admin/AGENTS.md`](../../bootstrap/admin/AGENTS.md): the
per-module `<name>/index.tsx` folder layout, the per-hook data layer,
`useHasPermission` gating on `copilot:use` (fail-closed, so a user whose
permissions haven't loaded sees nothing rather than a button that 403s), and
co-located `defineMessages`.

## Testing

`chatReducer`, the model-choice key helpers, `panelFrame`, `sessions`,
`groupConversations`, `agentsRoute`, `ToolStep/labels`, `copilotSlots` and
`MessageList/activity` are unit-tested (`nx test`) — this is the
first admin package with a jest config, `testEnvironment: 'node'` because the
tested code is pure. Anything that has to
be got exactly right about the window's geometry belongs in `panelFrame.ts` for
that reason; `usePanelFrame` should stay thin enough to be obviously correct.
The dock and the windows were driven in a real Chromium against a harness of
the actual components — tiling, the cap, titles, the marker's true _and_ false
positives, toggling, closing, drag persistence, Escape, and axe — but **that
harness is not checked in and does not run in CI**.

**The Agents view has `admin-e2e` coverage** — `apps/admin-e2e/src/copilot/`,
seeded by `support/api/copilot.ts`. The claim that it could not, because
`page.route` cannot fulfil an event-stream body, was wrong: it can. The whole
body arrives in one read, so what is lost is only the _progressive_ arrival of
frames — everything about a finished turn, including the **order** of its prose,
steps and change cards, is asserted against the same reducer a live server
drives. Only "watch it type" is out of reach.

The suites are shaped around the bugs this feature actually had, because those
are the ones that come back: New chat not bouncing into the thread you left, the
model choice surviving a trip through the CMS, the transcript's block order both
live and reopened, a run outliving the page as a dock pill and badging the tab,
the archive link appearing at all, the rename dialog's focus return, and an axe
scan of every state.

**The docked panel is covered too** (`dock.spec.ts`), and deliberately does not
re-assert the chat: those components are literally shared with the page. What it
covers is the window — the dock as the only entry point, `⌘J`, three tiled
windows and the cap that minimizes rather than refuses, a pill toggling with
`aria-pressed`, Escape collapsing rather than closing, close handing focus back
to the dock, the `— finished` marker and the tab badge, drag persistence per
**slot**, Expand as the way out of a bad drag, arrow-key moves, and the model
choice surviving a collapse.

**Skills have their own two suites** — `agents-skills.spec.ts` for the composer
(staging, the count in the accessible name, always-on shown but not sent, the
selection surviving a trip through the CMS, a reopened thread's chips, and an
axe scan with skills staged) and `skills-manage.spec.ts` for the page (the
read-only code row, create/edit/delete, the identifier not being rewritten under
a title edit, and the absent link for a role without the permission). Two of
them were written before the code was right and found real bugs: the always-on
skill was being sent in the request body, and the picker button's `aria-label`
was hiding its own count.

**One known gap, and it is a defect rather than missing coverage.** The
"reopening a thread focuses the window already on it" guard lives on the
sessions reducer's `open` action, which is the path the Agents rail takes. The
panel's own **history dropdown** does not go through it — it calls `chat.load()`
and reports the id afterwards as `meta`, which has no such check — so two windows
_can_ end up on one `conversationId`, holding two transcripts that immediately
disagree. Fixing it means routing the picker through a session-level "open this
thread" instead of loading straight into the chat.
