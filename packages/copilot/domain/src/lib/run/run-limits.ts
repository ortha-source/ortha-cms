 * and a multi-part question a handful more, so eight steps in two minutes was
 * generous. A write turn is not shaped like that: the model reads the type,
 * reads the entries it is about to change, proposes, reads the result, and
 * reports — and an instruction covering several entries repeats the middle of
 * that. Batching (`content_propose_bulk_save`) collapses the writes into one
 * call but not the reads around them, and runs were still ending on
 * `max-steps` with the answer half-written.
 *
 * All three move together on purpose. They are checked in the same loop, so
 * raising one alone just relocates the wall — a run given 30 steps and 120
 * seconds ends on `timeout` instead, which is the same truncated answer under
 * a different name. Every step is still authorized, audited and recorded; what
 * these bound is spend, and the ceiling that matters for spend is the token
 * one.
 *
 * Each is overridable per deployment — see `CopilotPluginConfig.limits`, and
 * `COPILOT_MAX_STEPS` / `COPILOT_WALL_CLOCK_MS` / `COPILOT_MAX_TOTAL_TOKENS`
 * in the host's `ortha.config.ts`.

 * nothing did. It reuses {@link RUN_STOP_EXPLANATIONS} rather than writing a
 * second set of phrasings, so the reason a user reads in the UI and the reason
 * the model reads here cannot drift apart.
 *
 * The dropped-tool-calls sentence is not incidental: `normalizeTranscript`
 * removes `tool_use` blocks a cut-off run never got results for, so work the
 * model can see itself starting is genuinely missing from what it replays.
 * Unsaid, the transcript reads as though those steps were never attempted.
