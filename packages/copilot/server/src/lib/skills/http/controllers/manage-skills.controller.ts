/**
 * Authoring skills — `GET /:id`, `POST`, `PATCH /:id`, `DELETE /:id` under
 * `/api/copilot/skills`.
 *
 * **Every route here requires `copilot:skills:manage`, and that is the whole
 * security posture of the feature.** A skill's `instructions` are prompt text
 * that runs for every member of the workspace, so writing one is authoring part
 * of the system prompt rather than authoring content
 * ([ADR-0010](../../../../../../../docs/adr/0010-copilot-skills.md)). The key is
 * admin-only in `SYSTEM_ROLES`; a contributor can use every skill and write
 * none.
 *
 * `GET /:id` is here rather than beside the list route because it is the only
 * read that carries the body, and the manage page is the only thing that needs
 * one. `OriginGuard` on the three writes, as everywhere else that changes
 * state.
 *
 * A skill that is not this workspace's is a **404, not a 403** — the repository
 * filters on the workspace and reports "not found" either way, so an id cannot
 * be probed for existence.
