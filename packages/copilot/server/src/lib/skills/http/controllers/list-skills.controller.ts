/**
 * `GET /api/copilot/skills` — the catalogue the composer's picker renders.
 *
 * Gated on `copilot:use`, not on the manage permission: everybody who can chat
 * can attach a skill, and a picker that showed nothing to a contributor would
 * make the feature invisible to the people it is mostly for. What it does
 * **not** carry is `instructions` — see `SkillSummary` for why.
 *
 * `WorkspaceGuard` because the catalogue differs per workspace: code skills are
 * deployment-wide, CMS skills are not, and serving the union to an unvalidated
 * workspace id would leak one workspace's editorial guidance to another.
