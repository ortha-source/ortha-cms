 * **The catalogue is the shared `ToolRegistry`** (ADR-0006 §2) — the same
 * instance the MCP endpoint serves — narrowed to the `copilot` surface. What
 * stays copilot-specific is the pure `resolveCapabilityProfile` in
 * `copilot-domain` and the `withheld` reasons it returns. Keeping that rule
 * pure is what makes "a viewer is offered no write tools" a unit test rather
 * than an e2e hope.
 *
 * **The caller's grants are the whole decision**
 * ([ADR-0009](../../../../../../docs/adr/0009-copilot-applies-directly.md)).
 * There used to be a second input — the workspace's auto-apply policy, read
 * here per run — and it is gone along with the table behind it. One resolution
 * per run, one rule.
 *
 * **Nothing here is cached.** [ADR-0005](../../../../../../docs/adr/0005-copilot-authority-model.md) §2
 * requires the profile be recomputed per run: permissions can be revoked
 * mid-thread, and a long conversation must not carry stale authority. The cost
 * is one indexed read per run, which the ADR accepts explicitly.
