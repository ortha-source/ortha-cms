/**
 * The content-type summaries the system prompt is built from — `name — label
 * (kind)` for each type the open workspace was actually granted.
 *
 * Two deliberate choices about where this reads from:
 *
 * - **The catalogue comes through `CONTENT_CATALOG`, not `content-server`.**
 *   That port already exists for exactly this shape of question, and it is
 *   owned by `workspaces-server`, which this package already depends on for
 *   `WorkspaceGuard`. Importing `content-server` here would put the copilot at
 *   the bottom of the package graph, which `docs/design/copilot.md` §4 rules
 *   out. Injected `@Optional()`: a deployment with no content plugin gets an
 *   empty list and a copilot that says so, rather than a boot failure.
 * - **The grants come from `workspace_content` directly**, mirroring
 *   `content-server`'s own `WorkspaceGrantsQuery`. That table is workspaces-
 *   owned and its schema is deliberately re-exported; inverting it into another
 *   port would mean workspaces depending on copilot.
 *
 * Scoping to grants matters: the prompt must not name a type the workspace
 * cannot reach, or the model will confidently offer to search something every
 * tool call will then refuse.
