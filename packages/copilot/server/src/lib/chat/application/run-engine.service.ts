    /**
     * Records the receipt for an `effect: 'apply'` tool — one that does its own
     * writing instead of handing back a draft for the engine to apply.
     *
     * The registry has always allowed the effect and
     * [ADR-0009](../../../../../../docs/adr/0009-copilot-applies-directly.md)
     * §5 still offers such a tool "exactly when a `read` one with the same
     * `requires` would be", while §2 keeps the `copilot_proposals` row as "the
     * whole paper trail" and names a binder that writes directly as the failure
     * the split exists to prevent. Both were true at once: an `apply` tool
     * parked for permission like a write, ran like a write, and left nothing
     * behind. Nothing shipped declares the effect today, which is why it went
     * unnoticed — and is exactly why the next binder to reach for it must not
     * have to know this.
     *
     * Two differences from {@link recordProposal}, both forced by the effect:
     *
     * - **The row is written after the fact.** The write has already happened
     *   by the time the handler returns; there was never a moment this engine
     *   could have stopped it. The permission prompt is what does that.
     * - **`kind` is `tool.<name>` and has no applier.** There is nothing left
     *   to carry out. The row exists to be read — which is the whole of what
     *   "undoable, never invisible" asks of it here.
     *
     * The model still gets the handler's own return value: for an `apply` tool
     * the return value is a *result*, not a change (`ToolEffect`).
