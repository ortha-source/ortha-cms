 * Applies a proposal through the plugin that owns it.
 *
 * **There is no human step any more**
 * ([ADR-0009](../../../../../../docs/adr/0009-copilot-applies-directly.md)).
 * This used to be the accept boundary — `accept`, `reject`, and a re-resolution
 * of the capability profile deciding whether the clicker could have proposed
 * the change themselves. All three are gone: the engine calls {@link apply} the
 * moment a `propose` tool returns, and the only authority check is the one the
 * offer and the tool call already made against the caller's own grants.
 *
 * What survives, and why each still earns its place:
 *
 * - **Applying runs the ordinary use-case.** This service never writes the
 *   change itself; it hands the proposal to the plugin that owns it. Same
 *   validation, same revision, same activity row, with the human as actor. That
 *   is what makes a copilot change indistinguishable from a hand-made one in
 *   the audit log — and it is what "undoable, never invisible" now rests on
 *   entirely, since nothing pauses to be looked at first.
 * - **The status flips first, and only once.** `decide` updates with a
 *   `status = 'pending'` predicate, so the applier is unreachable twice for the
 *   same row. That still matters with no reviewers in the picture: a model that
 *   re-proposes an identical change, or a retried run, must not write twice.
 * - **A failed apply reopens the row** with the message recorded. Nobody will
 *   retry it, so this is a receipt saying the change did not happen — the run
 *   engine reads it back and tells the model to say so rather than claim
 *   success.
