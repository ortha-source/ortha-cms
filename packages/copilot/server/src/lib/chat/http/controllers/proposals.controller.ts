/**
 * `GET /api/copilot/proposals…` — the record of what the copilot changed.
 *
 * **Reads only.** These used to sit alongside `accept` and `reject`, and this
 * was the accept boundary
 * ([ADR-0005](../../../../../../docs/adr/0005-copilot-authority-model.md) §5).
 * [ADR-0009](../../../../../../docs/adr/0009-copilot-applies-directly.md)
 * removed the human step, so a proposal is now a **receipt** rather than a
 * decision waiting to be made: the engine applies it as it is drafted, and what
 * is left to serve is the row saying what happened.
 *
 * They are still worth serving, and both callers prove it: the chat panel joins
 * them onto a reopened thread so the cards come back, and the row is the paper
 * trail a change made without review depends on. Keeping the read while
 * deleting the write is the point — "undoable, never invisible" is now carried
 * entirely by this record.
 *
 * No `OriginGuard`: nothing here is state-changing any more.

     * is a way to learn about someone else's *thread* — `GET
     * /conversations/:id` 404s a thread that is not yours, and a filter that
     * answered "yes, that id is in this workspace" would undo it from the other
     * side. So the filter is only honoured for a conversation the caller owns;
     * anything else is the same 404 the conversation route gives.
