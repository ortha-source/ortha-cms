/**
 * `POST /api/copilot/runs/:runId/permission` — the answer to a parked run.
 *
 * **A second request against a run that is still streaming**, which is the only
 * shape available: the run is an SSE response, and a response cannot be asked
 * questions. The run yields a `tool-permission-request` carrying its `runId`
 * and the call id, and this route resolves the promise it is awaiting.
 *
 * It intentionally does **not** re-check whether the caller may use the tool.
 * That is not a gap: the offer filtered it, and `executeTool` re-authorizes
 * against freshly resolved grants immediately after this returns. What this
 * route decides is whether the user *wants* the call to happen, which is a
 * different question from whether they are allowed to make it — and answering
 * "yes" to a tool their role has since lost still ends in a refusal downstream.
 *
 * It very much **does** check whose run it is, and the guards above cannot do
 * it for us. `copilot:use` is held by every role including viewers, and
 * `WorkspaceGuard` proves the caller belongs to *the workspace they named* —
 * neither says anything about the run. Without the owner check a colleague
 * could allow (or refuse) a write in someone else's chat, and a member of an
 * unrelated workspace could do it by naming their own: the `runId` is not a
 * secret, it is handed to the client in the `run-started` frame.
 *
 * The 404 is load-bearing rather than cosmetic, and it is deliberately the same
 * answer for "nothing is waiting" and "not yours". Nothing waiting means the
 * decision arrived after the timeout, or the run is parked on another instance
 * (the broker is in-memory — see its notes). Both are worth telling the client
 * about, because in both cases the answer it just gave had no effect — and
 * whether someone else's run exists is not information this route hands out.
