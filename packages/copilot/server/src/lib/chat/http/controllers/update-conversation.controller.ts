/**
 * `PATCH /api/copilot/conversations/:id` — rename a thread, file it away, bring
 * it back, or record the model picked for it.
 *
 * **Archiving is the only removal this API offers, and it is reversible.** A
 * thread's proposals are the receipts for changes that were actually made to
 * the caller's content (ADR-0009), so deleting a conversation would take the
 * only record of those edits with it. Hiding it from the list is the part
 * people want; destroying the audit trail is not, and if a hard delete is ever
 * added it needs to answer for the proposals first.
 *
 * A thread the caller doesn't own is a **404, not a 403** — the repository
 * filters on user and workspace and reports "not found" either way, so an id
 * cannot be probed for existence. `OriginGuard` because this changes state.
