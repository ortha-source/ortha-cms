/**
 * The claim this package makes about itself that is made entirely of
 * **absences**, and is therefore invisible to every test that drives it.
 *
 * `tools/server` is the transport-neutral seam: the contract a tool is written
 * against and the one place a call is authorized. Two consumers import it — the
 * MCP endpoint and the copilot's run loop — and the whole reason it was lifted
 * out of `mcp/server` is that a deployment wanting only the copilot must not
 * pull `@modelcontextprotocol/sdk` through this barrel
 * ([ADR-0007](../../../../docs/adr/0007-one-tool-registry-two-surfaces.md)).
 * That reason is only worth anything while the dependency really is absent, and
 * nothing that exercises the registry can tell: a `drizzle-orm` import, a table,
 * or a vendor SDK would leave all 27 registry cases green.
 *
 * So the observable is the source tree, and this reads it — the same technique
 * `packages/activity/server/src/lib/package-shape.spec.ts` uses, for the same
 * reason.
 *
 * The import check is an **allow-list**, not a list of banned modules. The
 * package is seven files deep and has exactly two dependencies; a deny-list
 * would only ever catch the vendor whose name somebody remembered to add, while
 * an allow-list turns "this package grew a dependency" into a decision someone
 * has to write down here. Every scan is guarded against reading nothing.
