/**
 * `ToolContext.surface` may change how a response reads, never what it means.
 *
 * The rule is stated as a universal over every tool handler in the workspace —
 * "never a check, a filter, or a disclosed field keyed on surface" — and a
 * judgment once retired it as unenforceable for that reason: a test can sample
 * individual tools, and sampling is not a universal.
 *
 * What makes it enforceable is that a handler can only learn its surface one
 * way. The registry stamps `ToolContext.surface` at dispatch and there is no
 * other channel, so the scan below does not need to understand what a handler
 * *does* with the field — it only has to enumerate who can see it at all. Today
 * that is one provider, for one reason, and the assertion is the list.
 *
 * A new provider that reads `surface` fails here. That is the point: it is not
 * a claim that reading the field is wrong, it is a claim that doing so is a
 * decision somebody has to write down. The companion assertion lives in
 * `packages/media/server/src/lib/copilot/media-tool.provider.spec.ts`, which
 * pins that the one existing reader varies a link and not the field set.

 * caller holds a bearer token and gets the `/v1` route the token can actually
 * fetch. Same assets, same workspace scope, same `media:read` — a different
