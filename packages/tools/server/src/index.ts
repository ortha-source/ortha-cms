/**
 * Public API of `@ortha-cms/tools-server` — the shared, transport-neutral
 * catalogue of everything an agent can do to this CMS, and the single place a
 * tool call is authorized.
 *
 * It lives in its own package rather than inside `mcp/server` (where
 * [ADR-0006](../../../docs/adr/0006-cms-as-an-mcp-server.md) §2 first put it)
 * because MCP turned out to be one consumer of two, not the owner: the
 * copilot's in-process tool loop injects the same registry. Importing it from
 * the MCP package would have made a deployment that wants only the copilot pull
 * `@modelcontextprotocol/sdk` through that package's barrel — a dependency on a
 * protocol it does not speak.
