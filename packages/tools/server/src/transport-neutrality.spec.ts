/**
 * No transport crosses the tool contract.
 *
 * The dossier used to state this as "no type and no function in the package
 * mentions HTTP, JSON-RPC or MCP", which the code contradicts outright: refusals
 * are Nest `HttpException`s, `ToolError.status` is a number documented as
 * HTTP-ish, and `ToolSurface` is literally `'mcp' | 'copilot'`. It was recorded
 * `stale` in the ledger and the dossier now says what actually holds, which is
 * narrower and load-bearing in a way the old wording was not:
 *
 * - **JSON-RPC does not appear at all.** It is MCP's wire format, and the
 *   copilot's run loop speaks none of it. A `-32602` or a `jsonrpc` field
 *   reaching this package would be one consumer's framing leaking into the
 *   catalogue both of them share.
 * - **No request or response object reaches a handler.** `ToolContext` is the
 *   entire world a tool sees, and the fields it carries are all answers —
 *   who is calling, where, may they — rather than a channel to ask down.
 *
 * `surface` is the deliberate exception and stays presentation-only, which
 * `surface-is-presentation.spec.ts` pins.
