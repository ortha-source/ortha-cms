/**
 * ADR-0003's one hard rule for this package, read off the files rather than
 * left to review — the dossier's §14 says in as many words that it is "upheld
 * by review alone", and it was not: `domain/asset.ts` imported
 * `StoredMediaTrack` out of `infrastructure/schema/media-asset.ts`, so the
 * aggregate could not be read without the Drizzle table it is stored in. The
 * types now live in `domain/value-objects/media-track` and the schema
 * re-exports them, which is the dependency the right way round.
 *
 * `domain/` must import nothing from `@nestjs/*`, `drizzle-orm`,
 * `class-validator`, or `../infrastructure`. The `@orthacms/nx` layer-boundary
 * lint is not wired up, and the violation is always a one-line convenience —
 * an `@Injectable()` to make a value object injectable, a persistence type
 * borrowed because it happened to have the right fields — that compiles,
 * passes every test, and quietly welds the aggregate to a framework or a table.
 *
 * A **type-only** import is not an exception. It leaves no trace at runtime,
 * which is exactly why it survives: nothing fails, and the layer is welded
 * anyway the moment someone tries to move it.
 *
 * **The accurate claim is "framework-free", not "dependency-free."** `domain/`
 * *does* import `@orthacms/database`, for the framework-free `DomainEvent` /
 * `createDomainEvent` contract (`events/media-events.ts`), and `node:` built-ins
 * (`randomUUID` in the id value objects, `Readable` in the storage port). Both
 * are outside the four prohibitions rather than exceptions to them — do not
 * "fix" this test by banning either.
