/**
 * Two boot-time checks on the storage seam, both of which exist because the
 * failure they prevent is otherwise invisible until a user hits it.
 *
 * 1. **The backend answers.** `provider.verify()` — a wrong bucket or an
 *    expired key fails the boot instead of surfacing as a 500 on the first
 *    upload, hours later, with nothing in the message naming the cause.
 *
 * 2. **No row names another backend.** A deployment runs exactly one provider,
 *    and every asset row records the `id` of the one that wrote it. Swapping
 *    the provider in `plugins.ts` therefore makes every existing asset
 *    unreadable — its bytes are in a store nothing is connected to any more.
 *    Left alone that is a library of broken images and a 500 per request; here
 *    it is a refusal to start, naming the stale id and how many rows carry it,
 *    so the operator either restores the old provider or moves the blobs
 *    deliberately.
