/**
 * Removes a deleted workspace's media — every asset row, every folder row, and
 * the stored bytes behind them.
 *
 * `media_asset.workspace_id` and `media_folder.workspace_id` are plain uuids
 * with no FK to `workspaces` (that table belongs to another plugin), so nothing
 * used to remove them: deleting a workspace left the rows behind *and* stranded
 * their blobs, which no later request could reach to reclaim — the folder
 * cascade and the bulk delete both need a live workspace to route through.
 * This closes both, and registers itself with the workspaces plugin rather than
 * that plugin knowing media exists.
 *
 * **Set-based, and deliberately event-free.** Unlike `DeleteAssetsUseCase` and
 * `DeleteFolderUseCase` this does not load aggregates or emit one
 * `media.asset.deleted` per asset: a workspace can hold tens of thousands of
 * assets, and their individual deletions are not separately meaningful — the
 * `workspace.deleted` audit row is the event that happened. What the blob
 * reclaim needs is the storage columns, so the delete returns exactly those.
 *
 * No locking here beyond the transaction: the workspace delete already holds
 * the workspace's exclusive advisory lock, and media routes are unreachable for
 * a workspace whose membership is being torn down in that same transaction.
