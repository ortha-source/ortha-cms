 * 2. **The disposition is decided here, by the same `isInlineSafe` the proxy
 *    path uses, and pinned onto the URL.** A redirect discards the app's own
 *    `Content-Disposition`, `X-Content-Type-Options` and CSP, and
 *    `media_asset.mime_type` is the uploader's unverified claim — so an
 *    uploaded `.html` would render on the storage backend's origin instead of
 *    downloading. A provider that cannot pin them declares
 *    `capabilities.directUrl: false` and is proxied instead; that is the whole
 *    contract behind the capability.
