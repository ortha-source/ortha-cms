 * `GET /api/media/assets/:id/raw` — streams an asset's bytes from the provider
 * that holds them. Stays behind the app's auth + `media:read` (media is private
 * by default).
 *
 * **This is the one media route without `WorkspaceGuard`,** deliberately: the
 * URL is consumed by the browser itself — `<img src>` in the library's
 * thumbnails and detail drawer, plus download links — and those requests carry
 * cookies but *cannot* carry the `X-Workspace-Id` header the guard demands, so
 * every preview 400'd. The scope isn't dropped, it's **derived**: an asset id
 * already determines its workspace, so we look the row up, then require the
 * caller to be a member of *that* workspace. Same boundary, one fewer thing the
 * client has to assert.
