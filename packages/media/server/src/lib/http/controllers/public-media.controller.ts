/**
 * `/api/v1/media/...` — the **token-authenticated** half of the media API,
 * sibling to content-server's public content routes and guarded by the same two
 * guards (which content-server exports; media already depends on it for the
 * `MEDIA_ASSET_RESOLVER` port, so this adds no package edge).
 *
 * It exists because a `full`-scope token can now author content, and a content
 * type's `field.media` stores asset ids that the writer refuses unless the
 * workspace owns them. Without an upload a token could never populate a media
 * field at all — so upload is part of "write content", not a separate product.
 *
 * Two routes, deliberately: **upload** and **read the bytes back**. Renaming,
 * moving, and deleting library assets stay session-only — attaching an image to
 * a record is content authoring, but curating the library is administration, and
 * `scopePermissions` withholds `media:update` / `media:delete` to match.
 *
 * The **raw** route is the reason this is worth building. The session route at
 * `/api/media/assets/:id/raw` derives its scope from the caller's *membership*,
 * which a token has none of, so a bearer got a 404 on the very URLs the content
 * reads hand out. This one derives the same scope from the token's resolved
 * workspace instead, which is the equivalent boundary for a credential that is
 * not a person.
