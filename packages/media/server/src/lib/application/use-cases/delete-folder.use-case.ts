 * Deletes a folder **and everything inside it** — every descendant folder and
 * every asset in any of them — as one transaction, then reclaims the blobs.
 *
 * This used to refuse a non-empty folder with a 409, which left the only way to
 * remove a populated tree as emptying it by hand, level by level. Deleting a
 * folder means deleting what it holds, as it does in every file manager; the
 * safeguard belongs in the UI's confirmation (which names the counts), not in a
 * server that can't be asked.
 *
 * Ordering and locking: the target is locked `FOR UPDATE`, then the whole
 * subtree is locked the same way and returned deepest-first, so a concurrent
 * upload/move/create-subfolder (each takes `FOR SHARE` on its destination)
 * serializes against the delete instead of orphaning a row, and no parent is
 * removed before its children. Blobs are reclaimed **post-commit**, so a
 * rolled-back delete never destroys bytes a surviving row points at.
