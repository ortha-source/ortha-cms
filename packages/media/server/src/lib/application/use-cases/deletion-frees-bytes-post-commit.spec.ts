/**
 * **When** a deletion frees the bytes, which is a different question from
 * *whether* it frees them.
 *
 * `reclaim-asset-blobs.spec.ts` pins what a reclaim removes — the original and
 * every derivative — and `blob-store-isolation.spec.ts` pins that the store is
 * empty after a delete that succeeded. Neither can see the ordering, and the
 * ordering is the half that loses data: a reclaim moved inside `uow.run` frees
 * the blobs before the transaction commits, so a rollback — a serialization
 * failure, a constraint, a lock timeout, anything at all — leaves the rows
 * alive and their bytes gone. Every asset in that folder then renders as a
 * broken image, and nothing in the database records that it happened.
 *
 * The failure is invisible to an HTTP suite for the same reason: the request
 * that rolled back returns an error either way, and the rows it did not delete
 * are still there to be listed. Only the blob store knows, and only if someone
 * asks it at the right moment.
 *
 * `MediaWorkspacePurger` states the same rule by *shape* — it hands the reclaim
 * back as a thunk it never calls (`media:I-35`). These two use cases have no
 * thunk to inspect: they await the reclaim themselves, so the claim has to be
 * made about the sequence instead.
