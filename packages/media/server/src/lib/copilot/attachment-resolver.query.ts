/**
 * Binds the copilot's `COPILOT_ATTACHMENT_RESOLVER` port — how a run learns
 * what the files someone attached to a message actually are.
 *
 * The same open-host inversion as the tool and applier ports: `copilot/server`
 * declares the port and never imports media, and media binds it. That is what
 * lets this reach straight into `media_asset` instead of the copilot having to
 * be taught what an asset is.
 *
 * **Workspace-scoped, and it omits rather than reports.** An id in a request
 * body is proven by nothing, so the filter is on the query and an asset
 * belonging to another workspace comes back absent — indistinguishable from one
 * that was deleted. The engine turns a short result into one error naming the
 * count, which is all a user can act on anyway; saying *which* id exists
 * elsewhere would make this an asset-id oracle in the one place a caller
 * chooses the ids.
