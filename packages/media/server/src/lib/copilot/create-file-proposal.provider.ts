 *
 * **It writes nothing.** Like every `propose` tool it returns a `ProposalDraft`
 * and the run engine does the rest: it parks the run for the user's approval,
 * records a `copilot_proposals` row, and only then hands the draft to
 * `CreateFileProposalApplier`. Because the run parks *before* the call, the
 * permission prompt shows the file's text — the user is reviewing a draft
 * rather than discovering a file that already exists.
 *
 * The file that results is not special in any way: it is an asset in the Media
 * Library, movable, renamable, deletable, attachable to a content record's
 * media field, and reachable through the same download routes as anything
 * someone uploaded by hand. Giving generated files their own store would have
 * meant a second copy of the storage seam, the workspace scoping, the audit
 * trail and the blob reclamation, and none of them would be better for it.
