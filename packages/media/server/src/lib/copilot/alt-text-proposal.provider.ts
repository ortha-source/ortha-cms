/**
 * `media_propose_alt_text` — the alt-text tool ADR-0005 §6 names as the
 * motivating case for auto-apply ("a team that trusts alt-text generation
 * should not click twice a hundred times a day").
 *
 * Like every propose tool it **writes nothing**: it reads the asset, drafts the
 * change, and the run engine records it for a human — or applies it directly,
 * if this workspace opted this specific tool in.
 *
 * The tool deliberately does not generate the text itself. The model already
 * has the asset's name, kind and MIME type from `media_assets_search`, and
 * asking it to describe an image it has not seen would produce confident
 * fiction. What this does is carry the model's proposed text to a reviewer with
 * the current value beside it.
