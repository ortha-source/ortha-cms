 * Applies `media.asset.create` through {@link UploadAssetUseCase} — the same
 * use-case the upload route calls, which is the whole point of the port
 * ([ADR-0005](../../../../../../docs/adr/0005-copilot-authority-model.md) §5).
 * Going through it rather than writing a row directly is what gives a generated
 * file, for free:
 *
 * - the asset row and its `media.asset.uploaded` event committed in one
 *   transaction through the outbox, with the accepting human as actor;
 * - a `FOR SHARE` lock on the destination folder, so a file cannot be orphaned
 *   into a folder that is concurrently being deleted;
 * - the blob reclaimed if the transaction rolls back;
 * - routing through whichever `StorageProvider` the host's resolver picks, and
 *   that provider's name recorded for later downloads.
 *
 * None of that is reimplemented here, and an applier that did reimplement it
 * would be a second write path with its own bugs and nobody reviewing the
 * result.
