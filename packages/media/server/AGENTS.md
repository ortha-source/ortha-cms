# @orthacms/media-server

The **media** bounded context — folders and assets for the Media Library, and
the provider-agnostic storage seam. It owns its schema (`media_folder`,
`media_asset`) and ships its own migrations. Bytes never live in the database:
each asset row carries a `storage_key` + `storage_provider` pointer, and the
actual blob is held by a `StorageProvider` implementation registered at the
composition root.

> **Layered per ADR-0003 (tactical DDD inside plugins).** New DB-backed context,
> born in the layered shape — reference: `packages/workspaces/server`.

  schema/  persistence/  queries/  storage-registry.ts
http/            # thin controllers (one per use case) + to-http error mapper
```

## The one hard rule

**`domain/` imports NOTHING from `@nestjs/*`, `drizzle-orm`, `class-validator`,
or `infrastructure/`.** Only `@orthacms/database`'s framework-free
`createDomainEvent`/`DomainEvent` and node built-ins. Self-enforce it (the
layer-boundary lint isn't wired yet).

## The storage seam (the whole point)

**One provider per deployment, passed as one object** ([ADR-0012](../../../docs/adr/0012-one-storage-provider-per-deployment.md)).

- **`StorageProvider`** (`domain/storage-provider.ts`) is a NestJS-free port:
  `put` / `get` / `remove`, plus optional `directUrl()` and `verify()`.
  Implementations ship as **separate packages**
  (`@orthacms/media-provider-local`, `-s3`) and are constructed at the host's
  composition root (`apps/server/src/plugins.ts`) — this package never imports a
  concrete backend, and `MediaPluginConfig` names none either (it carries
  `maxUploadBytes` and nothing else; backend settings are the host's, typed by
  the factory it imports).
- **The object describes itself.** `id` is the provider's own name — recorded on
  every asset row — and `capabilities` (`directUrl`, `contentTypeMetadata`,
  `streamingPut`) is what stops the core assuming the weakest backend. Declaring
  `directUrl: true` without implementing the method fails the eager check in
  `MediaServerPlugin`.
- **There is no registry, resolver or `defaultProvider`.** Bytes go to one
  place, so there is nothing to route between and no name for the host to
  register. Swapping backend is swapping the expression in `plugins.ts`.
- **Record at write, check at read.** `provider.id` is persisted on
  `media_asset.storage_provider`. Downloads, deletes and the workspace purge
  **compare** it rather than looking a backend up: a row naming another provider
  is bytes this process cannot reach.
- **`StorageProviderCheck`** (`infrastructure/storage-provider.check.ts`) runs
  `verify()` and that comparison at boot, and refuses to start when the table
  holds a foreign `storage_provider` — naming it and its row count. A missing
  `media_asset` table is *not* a failure: migrations are a separate step, so a
  fresh database must still boot.
- **Writing a provider** is one factory function plus one
  `describeStorageProvider` call from `@orthacms/media-provider-testkit`, which
  is where the port's invariants live as a runnable suite. Shipped
  implementations: `-local` (the default install), `-memory` (the e2e harness,
  and offline development) and `-s3` (S3-compatible: R2, AWS, MinIO, Spaces,
  B2, Wasabi…).

## Use cases + unit-of-work + outbox

Each state change runs inside `UnitOfWork.run` over the repo ports +
`OutboxWriter`, so the row and its `media.*` event commit atomically. Upload
streams to the provider **before** the transaction (it needs a `storage_key`);
an orphan blob left by a rolled-back commit is reclaimed in a `catch`. Delete
removes the row in-transaction and reclaims the blob **post-commit**.

## HTTP surface (`/api/media`)

Every route carries `WorkspaceGuard` (X-Workspace-Id → `@CurrentWorkspace()`)
and a permission-by-constant (`PERMISSIONS.MEDIA_*`); state-changing routes add
`OriginGuard`. Upload uses `FileInterceptor('file')`; download streams via
`StreamableFile`. **Folder delete cascades** — see below.

**`GET /media/assets/:id/raw` is the one exception** — it carries no
`WorkspaceGuard`. Its URL is fetched by the browser itself (`<img src>` for the
library's thumbnails and detail drawer, download links), and those requests send
cookies but **cannot** send a custom `X-Workspace-Id` header, so the guard 400'd
every preview. The scope is **derived, not dropped**: `DownloadAssetQuery.locate`
reads the asset's owning workspace, the controller requires the caller to be a
member of _that_ workspace (via workspaces-server's exported
`MembershipCheckQuery`), and only then does `open` touch storage. A non-member
gets the same 404 as a missing asset, so asset ids can't be probed. Any new route
whose URL the browser loads directly needs this treatment, not the header guard.

- `GET /media/folders` · `POST /media/folders` · `PATCH|DELETE /media/folders/:id`
- `GET /media/assets` (`?folderId=&search=&kind=&sort=&page=&pageSize=`) ·
  `POST /media/assets` (multipart) · `GET /media/assets/:id/raw` ·
  `PATCH /media/assets/:id` · `DELETE /media/assets` (bulk `{ ids }`)

### A download is treated as hostile bytes

`media_asset.mime_type` is whatever the uploader's multipart part **claimed** —
nothing sniffs the body — and `/api/media/...` is same-origin with the admin. So
both raw routes (session and `/v1`) go through `http/download-headers.ts`:

- `X-Content-Type-Options: nosniff` and
  `Content-Security-Policy: default-src 'none'; sandbox; …` on **every**
  response, so a document that does get rendered runs no script and loads no
  subresource;
- `Content-Disposition: inline` only for an allowlist of types a browser renders
  without executing (raster images, audio, video, PDF, `text/plain`); everything
  else — HTML, XML, **SVG**, unknown types — is `attachment`.

SVG is excluded from the inline set on purpose: `MediaKind` files it as an image,
but it is a scriptable document when navigated to. `<img src>` ignores
`Content-Disposition`, so the library's tiles are unaffected. Without this, an
uploaded `.html` was stored XSS on the app's own origin.

### A download failure is a 404, except when it is a corrupted row

Three ways `GET .../assets/:id/raw` can fail, and only one of them is a 500:

- **No such id, or the caller is not a member** → `404`, deliberately the same
  code, so asset ids cannot be probed.
- **The row exists and the blob does not** — a database restored against an
  empty volume, a hand-reclaimed blob, an interrupted migration — → `404` too.
  It used to be a 500, which was both wrong (indistinguishable from a missing
  asset, from the caller's side) and a signal (it told an unauthorized-ish
  caller the row was real). `StorageProvider.get` rejects with
  `ObjectNotFoundError` — a **port** error, raised by `provider-local` for
  `ENOENT`/`ENOTDIR` and by `provider-s3` for `NoSuchKey` — and `to-http.ts`
  maps it to a bare 404. The key travels on the error for the operator's log
  and never into a response body.
- **The stored key resolves outside the storage root** → `500`, on purpose.
  That is a corrupted `storage_key` column, not a caller's mistake, and calling
  it "not found" would bury an operator's problem under a plausible answer.
  `to-http.ts` rethrows anything it does not recognize precisely so this stays
  loud; Nest's default filter logs it with its stack.

Only `ENOENT`/`ENOTDIR` become "not found". A permission error or an exhausted
descriptor table is an outage and must not be dressed as a 404.

### Filters are validated before they reach Postgres

`?folderId=` is a `uuid` column and `?kind=` is the `media_kind` enum, so
`ListAssetsQuery` rejects an unparseable value with `InvalidAssetFilterError`
(→ 400) rather than letting the driver raise `invalid input syntax` (→ 500).
`?search=` escapes `%` and `_` so they match themselves, like every other search
in the codebase. The guard lives in the **query**, not the controller, because
the agent tool `media_assets_search` is a second caller.

### The upload cap is config, not env

`config.plugins.media.maxUploadBytes` reaches multer through
`MulterModule.register` in `MediaModule.forRoot`; both upload controllers call
`FileInterceptor('file')` with **no local options** so they inherit it. Don't
re-add a `limits` argument at the route — a module-level `process.env` read is
what made the host's config value inert. The registered limit is `cap + 1`
because busboy trips at `fileSize === limit`, so the documented maximum is
**inclusive**: exactly `maxUploadBytes` is accepted, one more byte is a 413.

## The token-authenticated pair (`/api/v1/media`)

`PublicMediaController` adds two **bearer-token** routes beside the session ones,
guarded by content-server's `ApiTokenGuard` + `ApiTokenWorkspaceGuard` (media
already depends on content for the `MEDIA_ASSET_RESOLVER` port, so this adds no
package edge):

- `POST /api/v1/media/assets` — multipart upload (`media:create`, so `full`
  scope only). Returns the asset whose `id` goes straight into a content type's
  `field.media`.
- `GET /api/v1/media/assets/:id/raw` — the bytes (`media:read`, which **both**
  scopes carry).

They exist because a token that can author content but not create an asset can
never populate a media field at all — the writer rejects an asset id the
workspace does not own — and because the session `raw` route derives its scope
from **membership**, which a token has none of, so a bearer 404'd on the very
URLs the public content reads hand out. The `/v1` route derives the same scope
from the token's resolved workspace instead: an asset outside it is the same 404
as a missing one, and that holds even for another workspace _inside_ the token's
bucket, so `X-Workspace-Id` stays binding rather than advisory.

`uploaded_by` is NOT NULL and a token is not a user, so a token upload is
attributed to the user who **minted** the token — the accountable human, and it
keeps the library's uploader column meaningful. It is not an authorization step:
that user's role grants are never consulted. `UploadAssetUseCase` now takes an
`EventActor` (`{ id, email }`) rather than a `PublicUser`, which is all it ever
read; the session route is unchanged.

Renaming, moving, and deleting stay session-only — `scopePermissions` withholds
`media:update` / `media:delete` from both token scopes. Attaching an asset to a
record is content authoring; curating the library is administration.

## Folder delete cascades

Deleting a folder removes **the whole subtree**: every descendant folder and
every asset in any of them, in one transaction, with the blobs (originals +
derivatives) reclaimed post-commit. It used to `409` on a non-empty folder,
which made a populated tree undeletable without emptying it by hand, level by
level — the guard belongs in the UI's confirmation, which names what will go,
not in a server the user can't argue with. `FolderNotEmptyError` is gone.

`findDescendantsForUpdate` walks `parent_id` with a recursive CTE (workspace
filter in **both** branches — a cascade that escaped its tenant would be the
worst possible bug here, so an e2e pins it), then re-reads the rows `FOR UPDATE`
and returns them **deepest-first**, so no parent is removed before its children
and a concurrent upload/move/create-subfolder serializes against the delete
instead of orphaning itself. (`FOR UPDATE` can't be attached to a recursive
CTE's own SELECT — Postgres rejects it — hence the two statements.) It then
**re-walks and loops** until the subtree stops changing: the CTE takes no locks,
so a subfolder created under a _descendant_ between the two statements would
otherwise survive its own parent's deletion. Once every known id is locked, a
re-walk either agrees or reveals the new child — and further inserts under it
now block on us — so it converges (bounded by `SUBTREE_WALK_ROUNDS`).
`reclaimAssetBlobs` is shared with the bulk asset delete so neither path can
forget the derivatives.

## Purges its rows when a workspace is deleted

`media_asset.workspace_id` and `media_folder.workspace_id` are plain uuids with
**no FK** to `workspaces` — that table belongs to another plugin — so nothing
removed them when a workspace was deleted. The rows outlived it _and_ stranded
their blobs: both delete paths above route through a live workspace, so once it
was gone no request could reach the bytes to reclaim them.

`MediaWorkspacePurger` (`infrastructure/purge/`) closes that. It implements
workspaces-server's **`WorkspacePurger`** and registers itself with
`WorkspacePurgeRegistry` from `onModuleInit` — the same inversion as the tool
registry, so the workspaces plugin never learns media exists. `@Optional()`, so
media still boots without it.

It is deliberately **set-based and event-free**, unlike the two use cases above:
one `delete … where workspace_id = …` per table, no aggregates loaded, no
per-asset `media.asset.deleted`. A workspace can hold tens of thousands of
assets and their individual deletions are not separately meaningful — the
`workspace.deleted` audit row is the event that happened. The delete `returning`s
just the storage columns, which is exactly what the blob reclaim needs, and that
reclaim runs **post-commit** through the purge outcome's `reclaim` thunk, for
the same reason it does everywhere else here: a rolled-back delete must never
destroy bytes a surviving row points at.

## Binds content's media-asset resolver

`MediaModule.forRoot` binds content-server's **`MEDIA_ASSET_RESOLVER`** port
(`infrastructure/queries/media-asset-resolver.query.ts` — a batched,
workspace-scoped lookup of `media_asset`), so a content record's `field.media`
values can be checked for existence + the field's `accept` restriction on save,
and resolved for display in the editor + revision preview. The resolved ref
carries the **derivative** routes too (`thumbUrl` / `previewUrl`, the same
`?variant=` URLs the library's own tiles use), so a record's media costs the
editor a thumbnail rather than a full-size original; an asset with no derivative
(non-image, SVG, tiny) omits them and the admin falls back to `url`. Same open-host
inversion as i18n binding content's `CONTENT_ENTRY_EXTENSION`: content declares
the port, media binds it (hence the `@orthacms/content-server` dependency; no
cycle — content doesn't depend on media). Both modules are global, so content's
`EntryWriterService` resolves the binding regardless of registration order.

## The agent tools (`src/lib/copilot/`)

This package contributes to the shared tool registry
([`@orthacms/tools-server`](../../tools/server/AGENTS.md)). Each binder injects
`ToolRegistry` **`@Optional()`** and registers itself from `onModuleInit`: a
deployment running neither the copilot nor MCP is normal, and media must boot
without either.

| Tool                     | Effect    | Requires       | Surface  | Wraps                  |
| ------------------------ | --------- | -------------- | -------- | ---------------------- |
| `media_assets_search`    | `read`    | `media:read`   | **both** | `ListAssetsQuery`      |
| `media_folders_list`     | `read`    | `media:read`   | **both** | `ListFoldersQuery`     |
| `media_asset_read`       | `read`    | `media:read`   | **both** | `DownloadAssetQuery`   |
| `media_propose_alt_text` | `propose` | `media:update` | copilot  | → `UpdateAssetUseCase` |
| `media_propose_file`     | `propose` | `media:create` | copilot  | → `UploadAssetUseCase` |

**The three reads are shared with the MCP endpoint** (they declare no
`surfaces`), and they are the registry's clearest case for it: an asset has no
draft/published state to leak, the library is workspace-scoped identically for a
token and a signed-in user, and **both** token scopes carry `media:read`. Before
they were shared, a `full` token could upload an asset over `/api/v1/media` and
then had no way to find it again. The two propose tools stay copilot-only —
their handlers write nothing and hand back a change for the run engine to
record, and MCP has no engine.

Changing any of the three now changes what an external agent sees. The decision
procedure for a new tool lives in
[`tools/server`](../../tools/server/AGENTS.md#adding-a-tool-decide-surfaces-deliberately).

The three reads live in `MediaCopilotToolProvider`; each propose tool has its
own provider + applier pair, and both appliers are registered by the single
`copilotAppliersRegistrar('media', …)` call in `MediaModule.forRoot`. The kinds
they declare live in `proposal-kinds.ts` rather than beside either tool, because
a `kind` is matched **exactly** against `ProposalApplier.kind` and nothing
type-checks the pair — a typo in either half produces a change that is drafted,
approved, recorded, and then fails to apply.

### Searching and listing

Two departures from the library's own list, each answering something a model
needs and a person browsing does not:

- **It searches every folder.** `ListAssetsParams.folderId` gained a third
  state: an **absent key** spans the workspace, `null` is the root folder, a
  string is one folder. The admin browses one folder at a time, so `null` had to
  keep meaning root; a model asked "do we have a logo?" doesn't know which
  folder to look in and would get "no" for an asset that exists. The query tests
  the key with `in`, not truthiness, so the two stay distinguishable.
- **It returns a narrowed projection** — id, name, kind, MIME type, size, alt,
  tags, folder, created, plus a `downloadPath` — dropping `variants` and the
  intrinsic dimensions. It still drops the full `url`: that is a route the
  _model_ cannot fetch, so it costs prompt tokens and answers nothing. The
  **path** is kept for a different reader — the person who asked "list the files
  in the library" wants links they can click.

    **`downloadPath` is the one field in the catalogue that varies by surface**,
    because the two callers authenticate differently and neither route serves
    both. The copilot gets `/media/assets/:id/raw`, which derives its scope from
    workspace _membership_ precisely so a signed-in browser can load it directly.
    MCP gets `/api/v1/media/assets/:id/raw`, which is `media:read` gated and
    fetchable with the very bearer token that made the call — the session route
    would 401 an external agent, and a link guaranteed to fail is worse than no
    link. `downloadPathFor` reads `ToolContext.surface`, which the registry stamps
    at dispatch; it is **presentation only**, and both routes enforce the same
    workspace scoping and the same permission.

`media_folders_list` is what makes `folderId` usable at all. Nothing else in the
catalogue told a model that folders have ids, so before it "what's in the Brand
folder?" was unanswerable however the search tool was described. It is flat with
`parentId` pointers (a model rebuilds the tree from those for fewer tokens than
nesting costs) and takes no arguments — a workspace has tens of folders, and the
paging metadata would outweigh the list.

### Reading a file's bytes

`media_asset_read` is the one tool here that reads bytes rather than rows, and
the one that widens the **prompt-injection** surface: until it, the copilot read
content the team authored; now it reads a file anyone holding `media:create` put
in the library, and a `.md` file is a fine vehicle for "ignore your previous
instructions". The defence is the one every tool result already gets — the run
engine wraps the output in `fenceUntrusted` (ADR-0005 §8) — and the real ceiling
stays the capability profile: a viewer whose copilot reads a hostile file still
cannot write anything, because it was never offered a write tool.

**Over MCP that first defence is the client's, not ours.** There is no run
engine on that path, so nothing here fences the bytes; an MCP host is expected
to treat tool results as untrusted data, and the same is true of every other
server it connects to. What does carry over is the ceiling, which is the part
that matters: the token's scope decides what it can do with anything it reads,
and a `read` token that swallows an injected instruction still has no write tool
to reach for. Both halves of that were weighed when the tool was shared — a
capability that relied on the fence to be safe would have stayed copilot-only.

Four constraints, all load-bearing, in `asset-text.ts` (framework-free, so the
awkward paths are unit-tested without Nest):

- **An allowlist on the MIME type, never a blocklist.** `MediaKind.classify`
  files a PDF, a Word document and a Markdown file all as `document`, so the
  coarse kind cannot be the filter — naming what we _can_ read refuses a new
  binary format by default.
- **The byte cap is applied while reading.** Buffering a whole asset and slicing
  afterwards would put a 50 MB upload in memory before deciding we wanted 256 KB
  of it, which is memory pressure anyone with upload rights could trigger. The
  stream is destroyed as soon as the cap is passed.
- **Decoding is fatal.** A MIME type is a claim, not a fact; an error naming the
  problem beats a page of replacement characters the model earnestly summarises.
  The exception is a truncated read, where `stream: true` holds back an
  incomplete trailing sequence — the cap lands at an arbitrary byte, and halving
  a three-byte codepoint must not fail an otherwise valid file.
- **`DownloadAssetQuery.locate` is deliberately unscoped**, because the download
  route derives the workspace from the row (an `<img>` tag cannot send
  `X-Workspace-Id`). Nothing upstream scopes this call, so the tool compares
  `location.workspaceId` itself — and reports a mismatch with the **same** "no
  such asset" as a missing row, or it would be an asset-id oracle.

### Authoring a file

`media_propose_file` writes a report, summary or CSV into the library as an
ordinary asset. Generated files get no store of their own: that would have meant
a second copy of the storage seam, the workspace scoping, the audit trail and
the blob reclamation, and none of them would be better for it. The file that
results is movable, renamable, deletable and attachable to a content record's
media field like anything someone uploaded by hand.

- **The model picks a `format` from a closed enum, never a MIME type.** Handed a
  free-text `contentType` a model eventually produces something like
  `application/x-msdownload`, and `MediaKind.classify` would file it under
  `document` without complaint. `file-formats.ts` owns the format → MIME +
  extension map and is the only thing that decides how bytes are stored.
- **The extension follows from the format**, replacing one this module owns
  (`summary.txt` proposed as `md` becomes `summary.md`, not `summary.txt.md`)
  and leaving one it does not (`2026.q3` keeps its `.q3`).
- **A path is rejected, not flattened.** A model asked for a report proposes
  `reports/2026/q3.md` readily, and `FileName` rejects separators anyway.
  Silently dropping the directories would file the report at the root while the
  model told the user otherwise, so this throws and the message names `folderId`.
- **Every check that can happen at propose time does.** The folder is verified,
  the name resolved, the size bounded — all in the handler, so a bad draft comes
  back as a tool error the model can correct and re-propose. The run engine asks
  for permission _before_ it calls a write tool at all (ADR-0009's injection
  mitigation), so these failures land after the prompt, not before it; what they
  stay ahead of is the write. Leaving them to the applier is what would make
  them unrecoverable — it runs once the change is recorded, with nobody left to
  retry for. `MAX_AUTHORED_BYTES`
  (1 MB) sits far below `maxUploadBytes`: the content arrived as a tool argument
  generated token by token, so a megabyte of it is a malfunction, not a report.
- **`CreateFileProposalApplier` calls `UploadAssetUseCase`** — the same one the
  upload route calls, which is the whole point of the port. It inherits the
  atomic row + `media.asset.uploaded` event, the `FOR SHARE` lock on the
  destination folder, blob reclamation on rollback, and provider routing, none
  of which is reimplemented here.

Both `UpdateAssetUseCase` and `UploadAssetUseCase` take an `EventActor`
(`{ id, email }`) rather than a `PublicUser` — all `attachActor` reads — so an
applier can reach them without fabricating a user to satisfy a wider type.

### Binds the copilot's attachment port

`AttachmentResolverQuery` binds **`COPILOT_ATTACHMENT_RESOLVER`** (declared in
`copilot-domain`), so a run can be told what the files someone attached to a
chat message are. A plain provider binding, exported from the global module —
unlike the appliers there is one media library, so there is nothing to merge
across dynamic modules.

Workspace-scoped, and it **omits rather than reports**: an asset belonging to
another workspace comes back absent, indistinguishable from a deleted one, and
the engine turns the shortfall into one error naming the count. Saying _which_
id exists elsewhere would be an asset-id oracle in the one place a caller
chooses the ids. `readable` reuses `isReadableMimeType` — the same allowlist
`media_asset_read` enforces — so the two can never disagree about what a run is
able to open.

Note what this is **not**: attaching a file is not a copilot write. The browser
uploads through the ordinary `POST /media/assets` first, on the user's own
session, and the run only names the id afterwards.

**Not offered, deliberately: deleting anything.** A folder delete cascades the
whole subtree with the blobs reclaimed post-commit, so there is no undo, and the
permission prompt has no way to render "this will delete 4 folders and 213
files". Handing that to a non-deterministic tool picker needs its own ADR, not a
provider.

## Register with the host

After `WorkspacesPlugin` (routes use `WorkspaceGuard`) and `IdentityPlugin`
(`PermissionsGuard`). The one provider is constructed by the host and passed in:

```typescript
MediaServerPlugin({
    provider: createLocalStorageProvider(config.plugins.media.storage),
    config: config.plugins.media
});
```

## Migrations

Owns its schema, ships its migrations:
`npx nx run @orthacms/media-server:db:generate --name=<change>` then
`npx nx run server:db:migrate`.

## Image derivatives

On upload, raster images are buffered and run through the `ImageProcessor` port
(`domain/image-processor.ts`; Sharp adapter in `infrastructure/image/`): it reads
the source dimensions (persisted to `width`/`height`) and generates WebP
derivatives — **`thumb` (≤320px)** and **`preview` (≤1280px)**, never upscaled —
each stored as its own blob under the same provider via
`PutObject.isVariant` (a reserved `variants/` key namespace, so a derivative can
never overwrite the original). The keys + dims live in the `media_asset.variants`
jsonb column. Generation is best-effort: a source the processor can't decode
(SVG, corrupt bytes) yields no derivatives and never fails the upload. Downloads
serve a derivative via `GET /media/assets/:id/raw?variant=thumb|preview`, falling
back to the original when absent — matched with `Object.hasOwn`, since `variants`
is a plain JSON object and a bare index would take `?variant=toString` for a
stored derivative and hand the provider an `undefined` key. Duplicate copies the derivative blobs too;
delete reclaims them (`Asset.storageKeys`).

## Not yet (follow-ups)

**Video duration probing**, wiring `directUrl` into the download route (the S3
adapter implements it; nothing calls it yet), and a `media.asset.deleted`
outbox subscriber for blob GC. (The e2e suites listed here before now exist:
`apps/server-e2e/src/server/media/media-assets.spec.ts` covers derivatives +
variant serving, and the admin side has `media-library.spec.ts` +
`content/media-fields.spec.ts`.)

## Commands

- `npx nx typecheck @orthacms/media-server` / `npx nx lint @orthacms/media-server`

## Insights read-model (`/api/insights/media/*`)

Three read-only aggregates behind the media widgets on the Insights page, all
`media:read` + `WorkspaceGuard`: `storage` (assets and bytes per kind, plus
totals), `uploads` (assets added per time bucket across `?days=`), and `alt`
(alt-text coverage across the workspace's images).

Grouped in **one** controller, unlike content's five: these are three
projections of a single table with one dependency and one permission between
them — the read side of one resource rather than three separate use cases. Each
still gets its own route, so each widget owns its own request.

Three details in `MediaInsightsQuery`:

- **`storage` returns both `count` and `bytes` per kind**, because they
  routinely tell opposite stories — a handful of videos can be most of the bill
  while images are most of the library — and a widget with only one of them
  would let a reader draw the wrong conclusion confidently.
- **`sum(size)` is cast to `bigint`.** `size` is a bigint, so node-postgres
  hands the sum over as a _string_ to avoid precision loss; the cast keeps that
  explicit and the `Number()` is safe because a workspace's byte total is
  nowhere near 2^53.
- **A blank `alt` does not count as covered.** An empty string is the markup for
  "decorative", so `withAlt` requires `length(trim(alt)) > 0` — counting it
  would report accessibility work as done that nobody has done.

## Alt text is stored per **asset**, and settable at upload

`media_asset.alt` is a nullable `text` column, surfaced on `AssetView`, on the
`MEDIA_ASSET_RESOLVER` ref content reads, and in the alt-coverage insight; it is
carried onto a duplicate. Both upload routes accept it at creation —
`UploadAssetDto.alt` on the session route, `?alt=` on `/api/v1/media/assets` —
because the only other way to set it was a second `PATCH`, which an unattended
import never makes, and 508 504.3 asks an authoring tool to prompt when the
non-text content is *created*. `Asset` normalizes it identically on both paths
(trim, blank → `null`), so whitespace can never masquerade as coverage.

What the model still does **not** have: a `caption`, a `long_description`, or
any **per-usage** override — a `field.media` value is a bare uuid, so the same
asset reused decoratively in one entry and as a hero in another carries one
description in both. That is ORT-83 / ORT-91, a cross-package model change.
Video captions have no representation at all: ORT-92.
