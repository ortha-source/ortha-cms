/**
 * Turning an uploaded file into a document.
 *
 * This is the boundary: above it everything is a `TransferDocument` this
 * codebase understands, below it are bytes a stranger chose. Two rules hold the
 * line, and both are about not trusting a claim:
 *
 * - **The bytes decide the format, not the filename.** A `.json` that starts
 *   with a ZIP signature is an archive; a client naming a format is a hint.
 * - **Nothing in the file names a workspace.** The manifest carries the source
 *   workspace and the importer never reads it — the request's workspace is
 *   stamped on every write. A hand-edited manifest is therefore not a way
 *   across the tenancy boundary, only a way to mislabel your own export.
