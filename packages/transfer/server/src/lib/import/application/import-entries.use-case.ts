/**
 * Writing a document back into a workspace.
 *
 * Three decisions shape the whole file.
 *
 * **One pipeline, two phases.** The dry run and the real run are the same code
 * with `dryRun` flipped. A preview computed separately would eventually promise
 * something the apply pass does differently, and the preview is precisely the
 * thing people trust before clicking.
 *
 * **Values first, links second.** Records are written without their relations,
 * then the links are applied once every row exists. This costs a second pass
 * and buys correctness on the shapes a topological sort cannot handle at all:
 * a cycle (`post.related → post`), and a pair that reference each other. It
 * also means a document's internal order never matters.
 *
 * **Every write goes through `EntryWriterService`.** Not "mostly" — every one.
 * That service is where field validation, the workspace scope, the
 * relation-target checks, the same-locale rule, the media-asset check,
 * revisions, outbox events and the bound i18n extension all live. An import
 * that reached for the table directly would be a supported way to write rows
 * that none of those rules ever saw.
