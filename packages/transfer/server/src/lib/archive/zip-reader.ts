/**
 * A ZIP reader, deliberately paranoid.
 *
 * This is the one place in the plugin where bytes arrive that nobody here
 * wrote, so every decision is made in the order that keeps a hostile archive
 * cheap to refuse:
 *
 * 1. **Read the central directory, not the local headers.** The directory is
 *    the archive's own index and carries every entry's declared sizes, so the
 *    entry count, the per-entry size, the total size and the compression ratio
 *    are all checkable *before* a single byte is inflated. A reader that walks
 *    local headers instead learns the size after paying for it, which is
 *    exactly what a zip bomb is built to exploit.
 * 2. **Resolve paths before anything else.** `../` and absolute paths are
 *    refused outright rather than sanitised, because a sanitised path is a
 *    guess about what the author meant and this author is not to be trusted.
 * 3. **Inflate one entry at a time, with a hard output ceiling.** The declared
 *    size is a claim; `maxOutputLength` makes it a limit.
 *
 * The archive is read from a buffer rather than a stream, and that is the
 * point: the upload is already bounded by `maxUploadBytes`, and having the
 * whole file is what makes the directory-first check possible.
