 *
 * A `localized` field **is** a candidate, and that is deliberate. A transfer
 * record is one *row*, not one record-across-languages: the English and German
 * versions of an article travel as two records and are stitched back into one
 * by their locale group. So a per-locale slug identifies exactly the row it
 * belongs to, which is what an import needs to match. What keeps `en`/`hello`
 * from colliding with `de`/`hello` is that the locale is part of the match
 * (see `keyFingerprint`), not the exclusion of the field.
 *
 * Excluding localized fields instead would leave a fully-localized type — where
 * every text field varies per language, which is the normal shape — with no key
 * at all, so every import of it would duplicate every row.
