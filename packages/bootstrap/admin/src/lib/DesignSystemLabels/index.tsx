 * button announcing "Close" in a German session, because localizing it meant
 * passing `closeLabel` at each of twenty-odd call sites and no consumer did
 * (`ORT-159`). Doing it once here means a new dialog is localized by existing,
 * rather than by remembering.
 *
 * A call site that passes its own `closeLabel` still wins — this is the default
 * underneath, not a ceiling.
