 * `useIntl`), so the host provides a single `IntlProvider`. Messages are
 * resolved from each descriptor's `defaultMessage`; a translation catalogue
 * can be wired in here later without touching plugins.
 *
 * Server state is fetched with TanStack Query, so the host also provides one
 * `QueryClient`. Plugins call `useQuery`/`useMutation` (e.g. identity's
 * `useLoginMutation`) without owning a client of their own.
 *
 * Routes split by `public`: public routes mount as top-level siblings, while
 * every other route mounts under a single pathless parent that renders the
 * `layout` a plugin contributed (or a bare `<Outlet/>`). The host is
 * auth-agnostic — it does not know that `layout` may wrap its children in a
 * gate; the contributing plugin (the shell) owns that. A `public:false` route
 * with no gating `layout` therefore renders ungated.
