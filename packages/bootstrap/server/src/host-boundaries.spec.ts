 * wrong about the first, which is not a vague statement about domain logic: it
 * is a list of four concrete shapes, and in this codebase each has exactly one
 * spelling.
 *
 * A guard is a `CanActivate`. An API route is a `@Controller` with Nest method
 * decorators — the reference routes are registered on the http adapter and
 * deliberately are not these. A table is a Drizzle `pgTable`. And all three
 * would arrive with a dependency the manifest does not declare, which is the
 * assertion that does not depend on spelling at all.
