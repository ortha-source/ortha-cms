/**
 * Infers database and release targets onto projects, the same way `@nx/js`
 * infers `typecheck` from a tsconfig:
 *
 * - a project with a `drizzle.config.ts` gets `db:generate`
 * - a project with an `ortha.config.ts` (the host) gets `db:migrate` and
 *   `db:studio`
 * - a package under `packages/` gets `build`, and a publishable one also
 *   gets `pack` plus an `nx-release-publish` pointed at what `pack` staged
 *
 * No per-project wiring — drop a config file and the target appears.
 *
 * ## Why `db:generate` is not cached
 *
 * It used to be, with `inputs: ['{projectRoot}/src/lib/schema/**\/*']` and
 * `outputs: ['{projectRoot}/migrations']`. Both halves were wrong, and the
 * combination lost work:
 *
 * 1. **The inputs could not be right.** Each project's schema location comes
 *    from *its own* `drizzle.config.ts` — `./src/content/index.ts` for the
 *    host, `./src/lib/infrastructure/schema/index.ts` for media,
 *    `./src/lib/*\/infrastructure/schema/index.ts` for copilot. Five of the
 *    eight configs in this workspace point outside `src/lib/schema/`, so the
 *    declared input matched **nothing** for them: editing the schema did not
 *    change the hash, and re-running `db:generate` with the same `--name`
 *    replayed a cached "No schema changes, nothing to migrate" — a green tick
 *    and no migration, which is precisely the schema/migration drift
 *    `.cursor/BUGBOT.md` warns about.
 * 2. **The output is also an input.** drizzle-kit diffs the schema against
 *    `migrations/meta/*_snapshot.json`, which lives inside the declared
 *    output directory. So the result is not a function of the declared inputs
 *    no matter how those inputs are written, and a cache *restore* replaces
 *    the whole `migrations/` directory — deleting migrations generated since
 *    the entry was written, journal and snapshot included.
 *
 * Deriving the inputs from each config would fix (1) but not (2), and would
 * mean importing eight TypeScript configs on every graph computation.
 * Generation takes about a second, is run by hand a few times a week, and is
 * run by nothing in CI, so the cache was buying nothing and risking the
 * working tree. `db:migrate` and `db:studio` are uncached for the ordinary
 * reason: they are side-effecting.

 * points at its **output**; ours point at `./src/index.ts`, because
 * workspace packages are consumed from source (AGENTS.md, "How packages
 * resolve"). That is the right trade for development and the wrong one for
 * npm, so the compile step is inferred here instead: `tsc --build` against
 * the package's `tsconfig.lib.json`, which emits JS and declarations into
 * `dist/` and builds its project references on the way.
 *
 * A publishable package gets two more targets. `pack` stages a publishable
 * package root under `dist/pack/` (see `tools/release/pack.mjs`), and
 * `nx-release-publish` is redirected at that directory rather than the
 * project root — the checked-in manifest is never what ships.
 *
 * Returns `undefined` for anything outside `packages/`; the apps build
 * through their own bundlers.
