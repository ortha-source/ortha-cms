/**
 * The claims this package makes about *itself* — its module system and its
 * exclusion from the release — which no test that drives it can see.
 *
 * Both are made of absences. A `import.meta.url` slipping in breaks nothing a
 * jest run notices, because jest transpiles these files itself; it breaks Nx
 * `require`-ing the executor out of the CJS build, at release time. And the
 * `!@orthacms/nx` in `nx.json` is not code at all: drop it and every test in
 * this package still passes, right up until the next release publishes the
 * workspace's build tooling to npm.
 *
 * So this reads the source tree and the two manifests, the way
 * `packages/activity/server/src/lib/package-shape.spec.ts` does.
