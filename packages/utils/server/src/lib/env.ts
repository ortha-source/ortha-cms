/**
 * Reading `process.env` into typed configuration.
 *
 * A host's `ortha.config.ts` is the one file allowed to touch the environment,
 * and every deployment writes the same handful of readers to do it: a required
 * string, a bounded number, a comma list, `TRUST_PROXY`, `NODE_ENV`. They were
 * duplicated between this repo's host and the scaffolder's template, where the
 * copies had already drifted — the template's number reader had no
 * "optional, no default" form, so a generated app could not express a ceiling
 * that means "leave the plugin's own default alone".
 *
 * Every reader here **throws rather than guesses**. That is the whole point of
 * the module: the failure mode of environment parsing is silence, and a config
 * value that is quietly wrong is discovered a session TTL later, or by reading
 * a `Set-Cookie` header, rather than at boot with the variable named.
 *
 * The last two exports — {@link when} and {@link defined} — read nothing. They
 * are here because they are what a host does with the readers' `undefined`:
 * plugins merge their settings as `{ ...DEFAULTS, ...config }`, so an unset
 * value must become an *absent key* rather than an explicit `undefined`, which
 * would erase the default it was meant to leave alone. Every host writing that
 * as `...(x ? { key } : {})` at each call site is the duplication this module
 * exists to end.

/**
 * A trimmed environment value, `undefined` when unset **or empty**.

 * configured" is decided once. That equivalence matters: `.env.example` ships
 * keys with no value, and `ANTHROPIC_API_KEY=` has to leave a deployment with
 * *no* Claude backend rather than one registered with an empty key — a backend
 * that is in the picker and fails on the first message.
