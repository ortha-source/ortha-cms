# @ortha-cms/users-admin

The members **admin plugin**: the **Members** page at `/users`, the **Invite
member** page at `/users/invite`, the **user detail** page at `/users/:id`, and
the sidebar nav entry.

## Layout — layered (ADR-0003)

This plugin is **layered (tactical DDD)**, mirroring the `workspaces/admin`
pilot. `src/lib` is organized into four layers, not the legacy per-hook `api/` +
`utils/` layout:

- **`domain/`** — pure TS, no React: shared view types (`types/member`,
  `types/session`, `types/workspaceOption`), the `Email` value object
  (`value-objects/email`, the single client-side email rule for instant invite
  validation), and the `MemberEntity` client entity (`member/`) exposing the
  **UX invariants** the admin mirrors from server facts —
  `canChangeRole(viewerId)` and `canBeRemoved(viewerId)` return `{ ok, reason }`
  so a control disables itself with a reason instead of failing on submit. Both
  take the **viewer's id**: the server refuses self-actions (you cannot disable
  your own account, or change your own role), and a guard that doesn't know who
  is asking can only mirror half the rules — which is how the Role tab used to
  invite a click that could never succeed and then report a generic "please try
  again". `canChangeRole` additionally vetoes a member whose `role` is `null`
  (see below).
- **`application/`** — the TanStack Query hooks (reads + mutations). Each calls
  the gateway, never `apiClient`. The invite wizard's submit orchestration is
  `useInviteMemberFlow` (validate `Email` → invite → toast → navigate), so the
  invite page is layout + fields; `useMembersMutation` is the shared mutation
  shell (normalize + invalidate `membersKeys.all`).
- **`infrastructure/`** — the `MemberGateway` **port** + its `httpMemberGateway`
  implementation (the one place `apiClient` is used), `memberMapper` (the
  wire→view anti-corruption layer, formerly `utils/toMember`, keeping the
  presentation-only `initials`/`color` enrichment), and `membersKeys`.
  - **The mapper does not invent a role.** A key outside the three assignable
    system roles maps to `role: null`, not to a guessed `viewer` — the server's
    `Role.create` accepts any non-empty key, so a custom role is a shape this
    admin must expect. Everything downstream renders `roleName` (the server's own
    label) when `role` is `null` and refuses to offer a change, so the UI never
    asserts a privilege level someone does not hold.
  - **`membersKeys.sessions(id)` is rooted at `member-sessions`, not under the
    member's detail key.** TanStack matches by prefix, so nesting it would make
    every member mutation invalidate every cached session list — which no member
    mutation can affect, and which runs at `staleTime: 0` so it refetches
    immediately. The separate root is what keeps the broad `membersKeys.all`
    invalidation honest. `membersKeys/index.spec.ts` pins the scoping.
- **`presentation/`** — pages, components, the `usersPlugin` factory, the
  `userDetailContext` Outlet provider, and `membersFilterFields`; consumes view
  models + hooks + the `MemberEntity` only, never wire types or `apiClient`.

The admin stays **thin** — no client aggregates or repositories; the server owns
business truth. `MemberEntity` wraps the plain `Member` view model on demand (so
React Query's structural sharing keeps working) rather than replacing it.

## What it owns

- The private `/users`, `/users/invite`, and `/users/:id/*` routes (lazy +
  `<Suspense>`), rendered in the shell's authenticated layout.
- A `SIDEBAR_NAV_SLOT` entry (`group: 'directory'`, `order: 20`). The pages gate
  on the `users:read` permission via `useHasPermission`.
- The sidebar-footer **account menu** (`AccountMenu`), contributed to the
  shell's `SIDEBAR_FOOTER_SLOT`: a full-width row (avatar + name + email) that
  opens a dropdown with **My profile** (→ their own `/users/:id` detail page)
  and **Logout** (identity's `useLogoutMutation`). It reads the current user
  from identity's `useAuth`. The plugin contributes an invisible `ThemeSync`
  into the **same footer slot**: it pulls the signed-in user's saved theme from
  `GET /api/preferences` into the design-system `AppearanceProvider`, so the
  choice takes effect app-wide on load. It must live in the footer, not
  `SIDEBAR_SECTION_SLOT` — the section slot belongs to `GlobalSidebar`, which a
  route can replace wholesale via `useSidebarContent` (the workspace shell
  does), so a hydrator mounted there would never run for a user who deep-links
  into a workspace. The footer is the region the shell keeps mounted in both
  contexts.

## The pages

`MembersPage` — `Container`/`ContainerHeader`, a search toolbar, the
**Member · Role · Status · Workspaces** table, pagination, a loading
**skeleton** (`MembersTableSkeleton`), and empty/no-access states. Each row is a
shortcut to the member's detail page (the name is a real link for keyboard
users); the row's kebab menu mirrors the detail tab bar — an **Account**
group (General/Role/Workspaces) plus permission-gated **Audit**
(Sessions/Activity) and **Access** (Sign-in access) groups that navigate
straight to a tab — followed by the status quick actions (Resend/Revoke invite,
Disable/Enable). Editing name/role now lives on the detail page, not an inline
dialog. `InviteMemberPage` — the invite form (role + workspaces), gated the same
way.

`UserDetailLayout` (`/users/:id/*`, via `UserDetailRouter`'s nested `<Routes>`)
— fetches one member once (`useUserDetail`) and shares it with every tab through
the Outlet context (`presentation/userDetailContext`), so a tab read is free. Renders
the back link, `UserHero`, `UserStatsStrip`, and the `UserDetailTabs` underline
tab bar (design-system `TabNav`) above the active tab. Six tab pages:
**General** (edit name), **Role** (`RolePicker` +
confirm), **Workspaces** (`WorkspaceMembershipCard` + `AddToWorkspacesDialog`),
**Sessions** (`SessionCard` + revoke), **Activity** (reuses
`@ortha-cms/activity-admin`'s `useActivityLog`, pinned to `subjectId`),
**Access** (suspend/reactivate **plus the password-reset link**), and
**Preferences** (`UserPreferencesPage` —
the colour-theme picker Light/Dark/System over `/api/preferences`, applied
optimistically through the design-system `AppearanceProvider`). The Audit
(Sessions, Activity) and Access tabs are permission-gated **at the route
level** — without `users:update` / `activity:read` the tab bar hides them and
the route redirects to General. **Preferences is self-only** — it carries the
current user's own app settings, so it is gated on `useAuth().user.id ===
member.id` (hidden and route-redirected on anyone else's profile).

## Destructive actions are confirmed, named, and give focus back

Two member actions are irreversible from the UI: **Revoke invite** deletes the
pending account outright (cascading its token and workspace assignments), and
**Disable** locks a person out and kills their live sessions. Both now go
through the design-system `ConfirmDialog`, naming the member — matching what the
Access tab (Suspend), the Workspaces tab (Remove) and the Role tab already did.
They previously fired straight off `onSelect`, which meant one extra `↓` past
"Resend invite" destroyed an account before the key was released, with the first
feedback arriving in a success toast afterwards (WCAG 3.3.4).

**Focus has to be placed by hand after a row-removing mutation.** Radix restores
focus to whatever opened the overlay, but that trigger is the row's kebab and the
row has just unmounted — so focus falls to `<body>` and a keyboard user restarts
at the top of the document (WCAG 2.4.3). The row menu therefore targets a stable
anchor explicitly: the member's own kebab when the row survives (disable, resend),
and `MEMBERS_TABLE_ANCHOR_ID` — the table wrapper, `tabIndex={-1}` — when it does
not. The Sessions tab does the same with its card heading. A `requestAnimationFrame`
defers the move so it lands after Radix's own restoration rather than racing it.

**Per-item accessible names carry the target.** Every session's visible label is
just "Revoke", so the `aria-label` names the device and last-seen time, and the
confirm dialog's *title* does too — a dialog's accessible name is its title, and
"Revoke this session?" on all four cards tells a screen-reader user nothing.

## The invite link hand-off

Nothing emails an invite yet (identity epic #11), so the **admin is the delivery
channel** and the raw token comes back exactly once. Two surfaces exist for that
one moment, both built on `InviteLinkPanel` (read-only link + copy button +
a plain warning that whoever opens it becomes that person):

- the invite wizard ends on `InviteSent` instead of redirecting — navigating
  away before copying would mean resending;
- **Resend invite** opens `InviteLinkDialog` with the rotated link, because the
  resend already invalidated whatever link the invitee had.

`inviteLinkFor(token)` builds the URL from `window.location.origin` — the admin
is already looking at the app on the origin the invitee should use, so there is
no `publicBaseUrl` to misconfigure and no host header to poison. A server-side
base URL becomes necessary only when the mailer lands.

**Losing the link is guarded, because losing it is not recoverable.** Esc, an
overlay click and the close button all reach `onOpenChange(false)` by reflex, and
a resend has *already* rotated the token — so a dismissal before copying leaves
the invitee with a dead link and the admin with no live one, fixable only by
resending, which rotates again. `InviteLinkDialog` therefore tracks whether Copy
was pressed (`InviteLinkPanel`'s `onCopied`) and intercepts the first uncopied
dismissal with a warning; once copied it closes freely. The wizard's `InviteSent`
step registers with the app-wide `useUnsavedChanges` guard for the same reason —
that covers links, programmatic navigation and reload (`beforeunload`), which no
component here could intercept on its own.

## The password-reset link hand-off

The Access tab's `PasswordResetCard` mints a single-use reset link for an
**active** member and reveals it through `PasswordResetLinkDialog` /
`PasswordResetLinkPanel` — the same reveal-once shape as the invite pair,
because it is the same situation: no mailer exists, so the admin is the delivery
channel and the raw token is readable exactly once.

Three details are deliberate:

- **The card gates itself on status.** A `pending` member has no password to
  reset (resend their invite) and a `disabled` one cannot sign in, so the button
  locks with the reason rather than letting the server 409 a click that was
  never going to work.
- **The dismissal guard matters more here than for invites.** The server refuses
  a second mint for a minute (`PASSWORD_RESET_RECENTLY_SENT`), so closing the
  dialog without copying is not even immediately recoverable — the dialog
  intercepts the first uncopied dismissal, exactly like `InviteLinkDialog`.
- **The 409 is read, not flattened.** `PASSWORD_RESET_RECENTLY_SENT` carries
  `retryAfterSeconds`, so the toast says how long to wait; anything else falls
  back to the generic conflict message.

`passwordResetLinkFor(token)` builds the URL the same way `inviteLinkFor` does,
and points at identity's `/identity/reset-password` route.

## Conventions

- Every module is a `<name>/index.ts(x)` folder, grouped by layer (ADR-0003):
  components in `presentation/components/<Name>/`, pages in
  `presentation/pages/<Name>/`, query/mutation/use-case hooks in
  `application/<useThing>/`, the gateway/mapper/keys in `infrastructure/`, value
  objects + entity + view types in `domain/` (`camelCase` for non-components).
- `pages/` stays **flat** — each page is just `presentation/pages/<Page>/index.tsx`,
  with no child component folders. Every component lives under
  `presentation/components/`. A component used by exactly one **other component**
  nests inside that component's folder: the row pieces (`MemberRoleChip`,
  `MemberRowActions`, `MemberStatusBadge`, `MemberWorkspaces`) live under
  `components/MembersTable/`. A component used by a **page** sits at the top level
  of `components/` — `MembersTable`, `MembersToolbar`, `MembersPagination`,
  `MembersEmpty`, `MembersNoAccess`. **Shared** pieces also sit at the top of
  `components/` — `MemberAvatar` (used by the table, `MemberWorkspaces`, and the
  invite page) and `MembersSkeleton` (the page's `isPending` body, the invite
  page, and the lazy routes' `Suspense` fallback).
- Data flows through the gateway seam: `application/` hooks call
  `httpMemberGateway` behind the `MemberGateway` port (the sole `apiClient`
  user), never `apiClient` directly; wire→view mapping lives in
  `infrastructure/memberMapper`. Presentation-only member initials/avatar colors
  come from the shared `initialsOf`/`asAvatarColor`/`avatarColorForId` in
  `@ortha-cms/utils-admin` (no local copies).
- Co-located `defineMessages` (ids `users.<area>.<key>`); `type` over
  `interface`; design-system primitives only; a11y per the `accessibility` skill.

## Tests

Component *behaviour* lives in `apps/admin-e2e`, which drives a real browser —
`src/users/` covers the roster, the wizard, the detail tabs, the destructive-action
confirmations and the Role tab's guardrails. The package's own `vitest` specs
(`npx nx test @ortha-cms/users-admin`) hold only what a browser can't reach: the
mapper's coercion rules, the `MemberEntity` guardrail matrix, and the query-key
scoping — each needs inputs the API won't produce on demand (a custom role key, a
member who is both you and the last admin).

## Commands
