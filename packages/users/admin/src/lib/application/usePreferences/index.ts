/**
 * Reads the signed-in user's stored preferences via the gateway. It resolves the
 * caller from `useAuth` itself rather than taking an `enabled` flag, so every
 * consumer is automatically keyed to — and gated on — the right user: the query
 * stays disabled until auth resolves (the endpoint 401s otherwise) and its cache
 * entry is scoped by user id, so a second sign-in on the same machine can't read
 * the first user's theme.
 *
 * The result seeds both the Preferences tab and the app-wide theme hydration, so
 * `staleTime: Infinity` keeps it from refetching under the two consumers — the
 * mutation writes the cache directly on save.
