 * is no mailer, so a "forgot password" form would have nowhere to send the
 * link, identity epic #11).
 *
 * Issuing rotates the member's reset token, so a previously issued link stops
 * working the moment this one is created. The member's own aggregate state is
 * unchanged — no password is set here and no session is touched; that happens
 * only when the *member* redeems the link — so the application mints
 * `member.password_reset_issued` directly, mirroring `member.invite_resent`.
 * The activity subscriber turns it into the `user.password_reset_issued` audit
 * row: handing someone a link that can take over an account is exactly the kind
 * of act a security review needs attributed to the admin who performed it,
 * whether or not it is ever redeemed.
 *
 * 404s an unknown member; 409s a non-active one.
