/**
 * Partial update of a member's display name and/or role. A member cannot change
 * their own role ({@link SelfActionError}, mirroring the self-disable guard).
 *
 * When the patch **touches the role**, the member is loaded under the global
 * active-admin lock ({@link MemberRepository.findByIdForAdminGuard}); demoting
 * the last active admin is rejected inside the aggregate against a count read
 * under that lock, so two simultaneous demotions cannot both pass. A patch that
 * only renames takes no lock — it cannot change the admin count, and making it
 * wait serialised every member update in the deployment behind one global lock.
 * Drains `member.role_changed`
 * (from the aggregate) on a role change and mints `member.profile_updated` on a
 * rename — distinct facts the activity subscriber turns into the
 * `user.role_changed` / `user.profile_updated` audit rows. 404s an unknown
 * member.
