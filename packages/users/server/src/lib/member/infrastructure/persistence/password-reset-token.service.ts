     * Lifetime comes from the host's `token.resetTtlSeconds`, so a deployment
     * that shortens or extends reset validity actually gets what it configured.
     * It is deliberately a different knob from the invite TTL: a reset link is
     * handed to someone who is standing by, an invite may sit in an inbox for
     * days.
     *
     * The delete/insert pair runs under a per-user advisory lock: without it two
     * concurrent issues can each take their `DELETE` snapshot before the other's
     * `INSERT` commits, leaving **two** live links where the contract promises
     * one.
     *
     * Pass `minIntervalSeconds` to refuse an issue that would destroy a link
     * handed over moments ago ({@link PasswordResetRecentlySentError}). Unlike
     * the invite flow there is no "first issue" exemption — every reset
     * potentially invalidates a live link, so the cooldown always applies.
