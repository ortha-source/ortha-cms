/**
 * Stable machine codes for the member domain's failures.
 *
 * The domain already distinguishes these precisely — `SelfActionError` is not
 * `LastAdminProtectedError` — but HTTP flattens every one of them to a `409`
 * whose only distinguishing feature was an English sentence. A client that
 * wants to say something useful ("promote another admin first") could then only
 * string-match that sentence, so `users-admin` showed one generic message for
 * every conflict and the actionable reason never reached the user in any
 * language (WCAG 3.3.1 / 3.3.3).
 *
 * These codes are part of the wire contract: **append, never rename**. The
 * English `message` stays alongside as a developer-facing fallback.
