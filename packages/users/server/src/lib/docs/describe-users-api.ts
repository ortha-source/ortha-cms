/**
 * The users plugin's pass over the host's OpenAPI document.
 *
 * Every member route returns a `MemberView` (or one of its two token-carrying
 * extensions), and every one of those is a TypeScript `interface` — erased
 * before `@nestjs/swagger` reflects the controllers, which is why the scanner
 * emits a status code and no payload. This pass writes the shapes back on,
 * without a decorator and without turning the views into classes. See
 * `packages/bootstrap/server/AGENTS.md` → "The response-schema gap".
 *
 * Pure: it takes the document and mutates only the paths this plugin owns.
 *
 * The `/api/users` prefix is **shared with identity**, which mounts
 * `/{id}/sessions` there. Each plugin's table names only its own tails, so
 * neither describes the other's routes — and a tail this table does not name is
 * left exactly as the scanner emitted it.
