/**
 * Stages one workspace package for `npm publish`.
 *
 * In the workspace every package resolves **from source** — `exports` points
 * at `./src/index.ts` and `tsconfig.base.json` sets the
 * `@orthacms/source` condition (see AGENTS.md, "How packages resolve").
 * That is a workspace concern, and a published tarball cannot rely on it: a
 * consumer has no such condition and no way to compile our TypeScript.
 *
 * So nothing about the checked-in manifests changes. Instead `pack` builds a
 * throwaway package root under `dist/pack/<projectRoot>/` that holds what
 * the registry should see:
 *
 *     package.json     rewritten — exports point at ./dist, workspace
 *                      dependencies pinned to the released version, `bin`
 *                      remapped the same way `main` is
 *     dist/            the tsc output (JS + .d.ts), plus any non-TS asset
 *                      that lived beside the source (e.g. styles.css)
 *     migrations/      verbatim, for plugins that ship Drizzle migrations
 *     templates/       verbatim, for the scaffolder's app templates
 *     README.md LICENSE
 *
 * `nx release publish` points its `packageRoot` here (the target is inferred
 * by `@orthacms/nx`), so the tarball is exactly this directory.
 *
 * It has to live at the workspace root rather than beside the package: the
 * root `workspaces` globs cover `packages/*`, so a staging directory inside
 * a flat package is itself read as a workspace, and npm refuses to run at
 * all against two workspaces with the same name.
 *
 * Usage: node tools/release/pack.mjs <projectRoot>
