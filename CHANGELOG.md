### 🩹 Fixes

- **alarms-admin:** offer only the workspace's own collections when creating an alarm ([9a04bbdf](https://github.com/ortha-source/ortha-cms/commit/9a04bbdf))

## 0.9.0 (2026-10-05)

### 🎨 Design

- **admin:** a floating work area, header-less pages and borderless tables ([26a37085](https://github.com/ortha-source/ortha-cms/commit/26a37085))
- **admin:** the work area is one white card on a light gray frame, and the right panel (Properties) sits inside it
- **admin:** page titles fold into the top bar; a page's actions and its tabs move up into it, and back links give way to the breadcrumb
- **admin:** list tables run full width with no frame and no row rules — a gray header pill and a rounded hover row
- **admin:** compact list toolbars: Columns and Filters are icon buttons, and Filters opens a large popover instead of an inline panel
- **copilot:** "Ask Ortha AI" sits under the work area instead of in the top bar

### ⚠️ Breaking changes for plugin authors

- **query-builder:** `QueryBuilderPanel` is removed — use `QueryBuilderPopover` (and `useFilterDraft` for the draft/apply logic)
- **design-system:** `InsetBarEnd` is now `InsetFooterEnd`, drawn into the `InsetFooter` under the work area
- **design-system:** new `TopBarTabs`, `PageHeaderHost`, `DensityProvider` / `useDensity`, and `Container width="full"`; `ContainerHeader` folds into a top bar when one is present

- **schema-builder:** fewer knobs, searchable grant, flags that undo ([a8450568](https://github.com/ortha-source/ortha-cms/commit/a8450568))
- **schema-builder:** a new type starts empty; description is a text box ([c376878e](https://github.com/ortha-source/ortha-cms/commit/c376878e))

### 🩹 Fixes

- **schema-builder:** declare express, which the error filter imports ([36c4fefb](https://github.com/ortha-source/ortha-cms/commit/36c4fefb))
- **schema-builder:** the structure rule says what it checks, and starts on ([dda60413](https://github.com/ortha-source/ortha-cms/commit/dda60413))
