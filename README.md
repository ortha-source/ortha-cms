# OrthaCms

A plugin-based CMS built as an [Nx](https://nx.dev) monorepo. A small, generic
**host** turns a list of **plugins** into a running app — capability lives in
plugins, not in the host.

- **`apps/admin`** — React 19 + Vite admin SPA
- **`apps/server`** — NestJS API
- **`packages/*`** — plugins (auth/identity, users, workspaces, activity),
  hosts, the design system, and tooling

## Documentation

| Doc | What it covers |
|---|---|
| [`AGENTS.md`](AGENTS.md) | Canonical context: layout, commands, conventions (read by all AI agents) |
| [`ARCHITECTURE.md`](ARCHITECTURE.md) | How the system is built — plugin hosts, data layer, request flow |
| [`CONTEXT-MAP.md`](CONTEXT-MAP.md) | Project map (every app & package) + glossary |
| [`DESIGN.md`](DESIGN.md) | Product & design intent |
| [`docs/adr/`](docs/adr/README.md) | Architecture Decision Records — the *why* |

## Getting started

Prerequisites: Node, npm, Docker.

```sh
# 1. Install
npm install

# 2. Configure — copy the example env and set DATABASE_URL
cp .env.example .env

# 3. Start Postgres
docker compose up -d

# 4. Apply database migrations (every plugin's pending migrations)
npx nx run server:db:migrate

# 5. Run the apps
npx nx serve server
npx nx serve admin
```

## Common tasks

```sh
npx nx <typecheck|build|lint|test|serve> <project>   # any task on any project
npx nx sync                                          # after changing cross-project deps
npx nx graph                                         # visualize the project graph

# Database / migrations (provided by @ortha-cms/nx)
npx nx run <plugin>:db:generate --name=<name>        # generate a plugin's migration
npx nx run server:db:migrate                         # apply all pending migrations
```

Package manager is **npm workspaces**. Formatting is Prettier (4-space indent,
single quotes).

Authoring conventions are encoded as skills under `.agents/skills/`
(`server-plugin`, `admin-plugin`, `accessibility`, `admin-e2e`, `server-e2e`,
`shadcn`). Before changing a plugin, read its package `AGENTS.md` and the
relevant skill. Recurring pitfalls to avoid are listed in
[`.cursor/BUGBOT.md`](.cursor/BUGBOT.md).
