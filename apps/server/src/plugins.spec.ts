/**
 * The shipped composition, asserted.
 *
 * `apps/server-e2e` never runs this function — it builds its own mirror
 * (`apps/server-e2e/src/support/plugins.ts`) so a change to the host's content
 * types cannot break the suite. That decoupling is right, and it leaves the real
 * registry with no test at all: a plugin dropped from the array here removes its
 * routes and silently degrades everything that injects its ports `@Optional()`
 * (measured: removing `ActivityPlugin` boots clean, logs nothing, and stops
 * writing audit rows), while the e2e run stays green because it never looked.
 *
 * So this asserts the two things about the list that are actually load-bearing —
 * who is in it, and what order the migrations run in — and nothing about DI
 * order, which is genuinely free (every plugin module is global, and every
 * `onPluginInit` runs before `NestFactory.create`).
