 * is not registered here either: the first entry is what a run that names no
 * provider gets, so a keyless `claude` at the top of the list would be the
 * house default and would fail on the first message.
 *
 * **A clone with no keys gets an empty list**, and therefore no copilot: there
 * is no scripted offline adapter in this list any more. The fake provider is a
 * test fixture (`@orthacms/copilot-provider-fake`, private and unpublished) and
 * registering it here made a misconfigured production deployment answer every
 * question with a canned sentence instead of failing. `COPILOT_ENABLED` is off
 * by default, so an empty list is the ordinary state of a fresh clone and boots
 * fine; turning the copilot on with no backend configured fails at boot, where
 * it is cheapest to diagnose.
 *
 * **Exported for `plugins.spec.ts`.** The order this returns is what decides
 * the house default, and it is unreachable from the outside otherwise: the
 * plugin object carries its `copilotConfig`, not its providers, and `server-e2e`
 * builds its own plugin list rather than calling `buildPlugins`. So a config
 * threaded into the wrong factory here would have passed every test in the

/**
 * Builds the host's plugin list. Shared by `main.ts` (boot) and the
 * `db:migrate` target (which reads each plugin's `migrations` descriptor),
 * so both see exactly the same plugins, in the same order.
 *
 * **What the order actually decides.** Not dependency injection: every plugin
 * module is global, and `createServer` runs every `onPluginInit` before
 * `NestFactory.create`, so no provider can be constructed before the database
 * connection is open regardless of position. Measured: moving `IdentityPlugin`
 * above `DatabasePlugin` boots and serves normally. `DatabasePlugin` is
 * nonetheless listed first because it is the only plugin that opens a resource
 * in `onPluginInit`, and the moment a second one does, that hook order — which
 * *is* array order — becomes load-bearing with nothing to catch a mistake.
 *
 * What the order does decide is **migration order**: `applyPluginMigrations`
 * walks this array, with no transaction spanning plugins, so a plugin whose
 * tables reference another's must come after it. `WorkspacesPlugin` follows
 * identity because `memberships` FK-references identity's `users`; moving it
 * above fails a *fresh* migrate with `relation "users" does not exist` and
 * migrates an already-migrated database happily — so the mistake ships and bites
 * the next clean install. `apps/server/src/plugins.spec.ts` asserts the
 * ordering; ORT-131 tracks making it a declaration rather than a comment.
 *
 * The rest is intent, and reads in dependency order for that reason:
 * `WorkspacesPlugin` precedes `ContentPlugin`, which scopes routes with its
 * `WorkspaceGuard` and binds its `CONTENT_CATALOG` / `CONTENT_ENTRY_COUNTER`
 * ports; `ActivityPlugin`'s read API is gated by identity's guard plus
 * `activity:read`, and workspaces records audit events through the globally-bound
 * recorder; `UsersPlugin` reads identity's and workspaces' tables and records
 * through activity; `I18nServerPlugin` follows `ContentPlugin` because it binds
 * content's `CONTENT_ENTRY_EXTENSION` port and reads its registry. Those ports
 * are injected `@Optional()`, so **removing** one of these plugins degrades
 * silently rather than failing boot — which is what `plugins.spec.ts` pins the
 * membership of this list for.
