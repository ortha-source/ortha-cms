/**
 * `tag` — a **localized** (`i18n`) collection that is also the target of a
 * many-to-many (`article.tags`).
 *
 * Because the type is `i18n` *and* is reached by a single/inverse relation
 * from another i18n type, `article.tags` is treated as a **per-locale
 * relation** — the picker offers only same-locale tags. `name` varies per
 * locale; `slug` is marked shared here to show a non-localized field on an
 * i18n type. It owns the **inverse** `articles` (a many-to-many back-reference).
