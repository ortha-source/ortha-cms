 * - `<a href="javascript:…">` — the Link extension's protocol allowlist, which

 *   them. Its text is descriptive on purpose: `inspectRichText` warns about
 *   "read more" and friends, and this body is here for the renderer.
 * - `<iframe>` — an element no extension declares, so the schema has nowhere to
 *   put it.
 * - `<p onmouseover>` — an event handler on a tag the schema *does* keep, so
 *   dropping it can only be the attribute filter and not the tag filter.
