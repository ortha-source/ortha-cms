 * point of the slot system is that the page has no knowledge of what is on it,
 * so the suite should find a card the way a reader does. The one exception is
 * {@link widget}, which uses the slot's own `data-widget-id` — that attribute is
 * how the page identifies a contribution, so asserting on it is asserting on the
 * contract rather than on markup.
