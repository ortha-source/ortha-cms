 * inside a workspace: the dock is contributed to the sidebar's footer slot and
 * portalled to `<body>`, so it is there on every workspace page.
 *
 * The sibling of {@link AgentsPage}, which covers the full-page surface. The two
 * share their transcript, composer and cards; what only exists here is the
 * window — several at once, tiled, collapsible to a pill, movable, and each one
 * carrying a run that must not be cancelled by anything except closing it.
 *
 * **Every window answers to the same accessible name** ("Ortha AI"), because the
 * header's visible title is a heading rather than the dialog's label. So windows
 * are addressed by index, in the order they were opened.
