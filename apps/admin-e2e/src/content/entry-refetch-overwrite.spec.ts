/**
 * **A background refetch must not throw away what the author has typed.**
 *
 * `ContentEntryView` memoises the editor's initial values on the record it read
 * (`resolved`, keyed on `editEntry`), and `useEntryForm` re-seeds whenever that
 * object's **identity** changes. TanStack Query's structural sharing hides this
 * for as long as the answer keeps coming back deeply equal — which is why a
 * focus refetch of an *unchanged* record is harmless, and why this is invisible
 * in a suite where nothing ever changes underneath.
 *
 * It stops being harmless the moment the answer differs. The editor's entry read
 * has a `staleTime` of 30 s and `refetchOnWindowFocus` is on, so an author who
 * leaves a half-written record to check something and comes back gets a refetch;
 * if a colleague saved in the meantime, the refetched row is a new object, the
 * memo re-keys, and the form re-seeds **over the author's unsaved edits**. No
 * prompt, no conflict notice, no undo — the unsaved-changes guard never fires
 * because nothing navigated.
 *
 * This is the same mechanism as `ORT-228` (`i18n-translation-draft.spec.ts`),
 * reached through the other dependency of the same memo: there it was the
 * create prefill re-identified by the history API, here it is the record itself
 * genuinely changing. `useCreatePrefill` fixed the first; this one is fixed by
 * `useEntryForm` **refusing** a re-seed while the form holds edits, and saying
 * so in a banner offering to take the newer values instead.
 *
 * **Pre-existing on `main`** — found driving the live stack during `ORT-227`
 * QA cycle 2, and reproduced by hand twice against a real server before this was
 * written. It is *not* a regression from that branch.
 *
 * Read a failure by which assertion fires:
 *
 *   - the stored title      → the mock never served the record; the rest means
 *                             nothing.
 *   - the typed title       → the fill was dropped, same.
 *   - the rail's Status     → the refetch never landed, so the final assertion
 *                             would be true of a tab nothing woke.
 *   - the last one          → the defect: the refetch overwrote the author.
 *
 * The refusal is only half of it, which is why the pristine case below is not
 * optional: a change that simply stopped re-seeding altogether would satisfy
 * every assertion in the first two tests and leave the editor unable to show a
 * record it had just re-read.
