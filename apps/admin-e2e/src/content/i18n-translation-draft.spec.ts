/**
 * The **translation draft** the locale menu opens (`ORT-227` AC-7): picking a
 * locale that has no sibling navigates to `…/new?locale=<slug>&localeGroupId=…`
 * carrying the source record's shared values in `location.state`, so the new
 * row starts from what the group already agrees on.
 *
 * These two pin what happens to the editor's **own** input afterwards, and they
 * are halves of one contract: a tab move keeps the draft, **and** it does not
 * prompt about it. Both are about the same click, which is why they live
 * together.
 *
 * The editor's tabs are route segments (`/new/relations`), so moving between
 * them is a navigation — but it is a navigation **within one draft**, not to
 * another record. That distinction is the whole contract here:
 *
 *   - The draft survives it. It did not always: `onTabChange` navigates with
 *     `state: location.state`, the history API structured-clones that state, and
 *     the prefill came back equal but differently *identified* — enough to
 *     re-key the memo behind `useEntryForm`'s `initialValues` and re-seed the
 *     form over whatever had been typed. The translation draft is the one create
 *     path carrying state, which is why it alone lost its title and slug while a
 *     plain create kept them. Fixed by snapshotting the prefill once per create
 *     session (`useCreatePrefill`).
 *   - Nothing asks the author to confirm it. The unsaved-changes guard is for
 *     leaving a record for a *different* one — which is what a locale switch
 *     does, and it is guarded there (`i18n.spec.ts`, "picking a locale with
 *     unsaved edits asks first, then completes"). A tab move leaves nothing, so
 *     a prompt would be a nag rather than a safeguard.
 *
 * **Both tests must prove the draft is dirty before they lean on it.** A test
 * that skips the read-back would be asserting about a *clean* form: the title
 * would have been empty all along, no guard could have fired, and the second
 * test below would pass without touching the behaviour it names.
 *
 * Found driving the live stack for `ORT-227`; the regression they pin is
 * `ORT-228`.
