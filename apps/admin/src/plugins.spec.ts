/**
 * The shipped admin composition, asserted.
 *
 * `apps/admin-e2e` drives the assembled app, which proves the happy path
 * assembles — and can say nothing about the two ways this list can be wrong
 * while still rendering something plausible:
 *
 * 1. **A layout ahead of the shell's.** `createAdmin` mounts the *first* plugin
 *    `layout` it finds. The shell's is what composes identity's `RequireAuth`, so
 *    a second contributor registered earlier does not merely change the chrome —
 *    every private route renders **ungated** while signed out. There is exactly
 *    one layout contributor in the repo today, which is what makes the shipped
 *    order safe; nothing recorded that, so nothing would notice a second one.
 * 2. **A plugin quietly dropped.** Its routes stop existing and its slot
 *    contributions stop appearing, with no error anywhere — the sidebar is simply
 *    shorter, and every suite that does not open that page stays green.
 *
 * Both are decisions made in `plugins.ts` and observable from it, so they are
 * pinned here rather than through a browser. What is deliberately *not* asserted
 * is relative order between slot-filling plugins: slots are module-level
 * singletons registered before the first render, so that order is free (measured
 * on a live stack — moving `ContentPlugin` after `I18nPlugin` changes nothing but
 * the order of items within a slot).
