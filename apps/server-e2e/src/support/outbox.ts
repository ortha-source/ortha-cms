 * interval started at bootstrap. Stubbing `drain` covers the first; clearing
 * the timer (via the real teardown hook) covers the second — without it a
 * background tick would deliver the events a moment after the assertion and
 * make the test flaky rather than wrong.
 *
 * This is how a subscriber process being down is simulated: `run` swallows a
 * failed drain by design, so the mutation still commits and the rows simply
 * stay undispatched — which is the whole point of an outbox and exactly what
 * the recovery assertion then exercises.
