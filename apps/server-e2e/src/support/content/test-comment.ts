/**
 * `test_comment` — the e2e-owned equivalent of the app's `comment`. The "many"
 * side of a one-to-many with {@link testArticle} (one article has many
 * comments). The relation is a **required** single relation on this collection,
 * producing an `article_id` FK column — exactly how a one-to-many is stored (the
 * "one" side owns no column). `onDelete` defaults to `'cascade'` for a required
 * relation, so deleting an article removes its comments.
 *
 * It also carries the model's only **`onDelete: 'restrict'`** relation
 * (`seoNote`): an optional single relation that explicitly refuses the delete of
 * a row still pointed at, so a spec can prove that refusal surfaces as a `409`
 * rather than a raw foreign-key `500`. `restrict` is otherwise unreachable
 * here — it is the default only for a *required* relation, and every required
 * relation in this model wants cascade.
 *
 * Owned by the server-e2e harness.
