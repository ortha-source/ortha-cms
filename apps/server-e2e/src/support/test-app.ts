/**
 * Binds the app's HTTP server to an ephemeral port **on `127.0.0.1`**, once,
 * before any test touches it.
 *
 * ## Why this exists
 *
 * Left unlistened, supertest listens for us — and it does it wrong in a way
 * that cost this suite roughly two tests per full run, on a different pair
 * every time, for as long as anyone has run it end to end:
 *
 * ```js
 * // supertest/lib/test.js
 * serverAddress(app, path) {
 *     const addr = app.address();
 *     if (!addr) this._server = app.listen(0);      // binds the WILDCARD
 *     const port = app.address().port;
 *     return 'http://127.0.0.1:' + port + path;      // dials LOOPBACK
 * }
 * ```
 *
 * `listen(0)` with no host binds `0.0.0.0`/`::`, and Node sets `SO_REUSEADDR`,
 * which on **BSD/macOS** lets that bind **succeed on a port another process
 * already holds bound to `127.0.0.1` specifically**. The more specific socket
 * wins for loopback traffic, so the request that follows is answered by the
 * stranger. On a developer machine those strangers are ordinary: a JetBrains
 * IDE's built-in server (`127.0.0.1:63342`), the JetBrains toolbox, an Electron
 * app's local bridge. They answer `403`, or `301`, or hang up — which is
 * exactly the shape the failures took (a content write "refused" 403, a
 * `read ECONNRESET`).
 *
 * Linux refuses the overlap (`SO_REUSEADDR` there only covers `TIME_WAIT`), so
 * a Linux runner never saw this — which is worth knowing before a CI gate is
 * read as proof the developer machines are fine.
 *
 * It was rare-but-inevitable rather than random because supertest **closes the
 * server again after every request** (`Test.end` → `server.close()`), so the
 * old harness re-bound a fresh ephemeral port for *each* of the ~35 000
 * requests a full run makes. macOS hands out 49152–65535 and each request burns
 * two (the listener and the client's source port), so a full run cycles the
 * whole range about four times and lands on every occupied port about four
 * times. A per-directory run never gets far enough round the ring to hit one,
 * which is why the instability was invisible until someone ran the suite whole.
 *
 * Naming the address closes it completely: the kernel will not hand a
 * `127.0.0.1` listen a port that is already bound on `127.0.0.1` (it answers
 * `EADDRINUSE` and picks another), so a collision cannot be constructed. Doing
 * it here also means `app.address()` is already set when supertest looks, so it
 * neither listens nor closes — one bind per spec file instead of one per
 * request, and connections stay keep-alive across a file.
 *
 * `harness-binding.spec.ts` pins both halves.
