 * answer therefore has to be sent *while the response is still open* — a
 * buffered read deadlocks, because the body only completes once the run does
 * and the run only continues once it is answered. `onFrame` is where that
 * second request is fired from; it is called synchronously, so an async answer
 * should be started (not awaited) inside it.

 * chunk edges — a frame can arrive in two TCP reads, and two frames can arrive
