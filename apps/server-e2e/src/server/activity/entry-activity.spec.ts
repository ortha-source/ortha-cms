/**
 * `GET /api/activity/entries/:entryId` — one entry's own audit trail, the route
 * the entry editor's rail calls.
 *
 * It is the **only** read in this plugin that is scoped by workspace, and the
 * only one gated on `content:read` rather than `activity:read`: the full log is
 * deployment-wide and admin-only, so this route deliberately answers a narrower
 * question with a weaker key. That trade only holds if the narrowing is real,
 * which is what this suite exists to say. Nothing asserted it before — an
 * implementation that dropped the `workspace_id` predicate would have served an
 * editor in one workspace the history of an entry in another, and every test
 * would still have passed.
 *
 * The rule fails **closed** in both directions: an entry id from another
 * workspace reads as an empty history rather than as somebody else's, and a row
 * whose `workspace_id` is null (written before the column existed) is excluded
 * rather than assumed harmless. Losing old history on this narrow route is the
 * side to err on; the full log still has those rows.
