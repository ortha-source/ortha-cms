/**
 * Every route the app serves, walked without a session.
 *
 * `AuthGuard` is registered as `APP_GUARD`, so authentication is the default
 * and publicness is a decision somebody has to write down — `@Public()`. The
 * risk that arrangement carries is not that the guard breaks; it is that a new
 * controller is written with `@Public()` copied from the one beside it, or that
 * a whole plugin is mounted outside the guard, and nothing notices because the
 * suite for that plugin only ever tests it while signed in.
 *
 * So this suite does not test a route. It reads the **live OpenAPI document** —
 * the app's own account of what it serves — and requires every operation in it
 * to answer `401` to an anonymous caller, except the ones named below. The list
 * is the point: adding a public route means editing it, in a file whose whole
 * subject is what may be reached without signing in.
 *
 * ## What "public" means here
 *
 * Two different things, and only the first is in the list:
 *
 * - **Genuinely anonymous** — the eleven identity routes. Somebody signing in,
 *   accepting an invite, following a reset link or coming back from an identity
 *   provider has no session by definition.
 * - **`@Public()` but not open** — everything under `/api/v1`. Those routes opt
 *   out of the *session* guard because they authenticate a bearer token
 *   instead, and `ApiTokenGuard` answers a caller with no `Authorization`
 *   header with the same `401`. They are therefore covered by the sweep rather
 *   than exempted from it, which is exactly right: if one of them ever lost its
 *   token guard, this suite would catch it.
 *
 * ## Reading the document rather than the router
 *
 * The document is what an operator sees and what a client is generated from, so
 * a route that is in it is a route the product admits to serving. It is also
 * mounted *after* the global prefix, so its paths are the real URLs.
 *
 * Two things are consequently invisible here, and both are named rather than
 * silently missed: the MCP endpoint (`@ApiExcludeController`) and the GraphiQL
 * playground (`@ApiExcludeEndpoint`), which are probed explicitly at the end.
