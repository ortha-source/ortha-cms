/**
 * Email uniqueness is enforced **by the database**, case-insensitively.
 *
 * The application already lower-cases addresses on the way in, and the invite
 * route already refuses a duplicate — so why insist on the index? Because an
 * address is the account's identity, and a second row for the same person is
 * not a cosmetic problem: `POST /auth/login` looks an address up and takes what
 * it finds, so two rows means one of the two accounts silently becomes
 * unreachable while its permissions, sessions and audit trail carry on
 * existing. Which of them answers is a matter of row order.
 *
 * Application-level checks cannot close that on their own. Every one of them is
 * read-then-write, so two concurrent invites for the same address both read
 * "no such user" and both insert. The unique index is the only thing that is
 * atomic with the write, and it is the reason the invite route can be a check
 * rather than a lock.
 *
 * These tests therefore go **around** the application — inserting straight into
 * `users` — because that is the only way to ask the database the question. A
 * test that went through the API would be re-testing the application check that
 * this index is the backstop for.
