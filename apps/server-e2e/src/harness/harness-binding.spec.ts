/**
 * Where the harness's HTTP server is bound — the fix for the instability that
 * cost this suite roughly two tests per full run, on a different pair every
 * time, for as long as anyone had run it end to end.
 *
 * `supertest` builds every URL as `http://127.0.0.1:<port>`, but the listen it
 * performs for you names no address:
 *
 * ```js
 * if (!addr) this._server = app.listen(0);          // binds the WILDCARD
 * return 'http://127.0.0.1:' + app.address().port;  // dials LOOPBACK
 * ```
 *
 * Node sets `SO_REUSEADDR`, so a wildcard bind **succeeds** on a port another
 * process already holds bound to `127.0.0.1` specifically, and the more
 * specific socket wins the loopback traffic. The request is then answered by
 * that other process — a JetBrains IDE's built-in server, an Electron app's
 * local bridge — which replies `403`, or `301`, or hangs up. That is exactly
 * the shape the lost tests took, and it was reached about four times a run
 * because supertest closes the server after every request, so the old harness
 * re-bound a fresh ephemeral port ~35 000 times and cycled the whole
 * 49152–65535 range roughly four times over.
 *
 * `createTestApp` therefore binds `127.0.0.1` itself, before a test can touch
 * the server. The two claims below are the ones that keep it that way.
