    // `maxWorkers: 1` also decides *where* the specs run, which is not obvious
    // and is what the memory story below turns on. Jest's `shouldRunInBand`
    // returns true on `maxWorkers <= 1`, so this suite runs **in band** — every
    // spec file executes in the task process itself, not in a forked worker.
    // One long-lived process for all ~94 files, and nothing recycles it.
    //
    // Its heap therefore climbs monotonically: 1.3 GB at 12 minutes, 2.0 GB at
    // 25, each file booting its own Nest app in its own module registry. Node's
    // default old-space ceiling is sized from total RAM — 2.2 GB on an 8 GB
    // machine — so a full run hits it around minute 20 and dies with
    // "Ineffective mark-compacts near heap limit", blamed on whichever suite was
    // running. **The ceiling is raised in `.env.e2e`**, which Nx loads for this
    // target; `global-setup` warns if a run somehow starts without it.
    //
    // NOT set: `workerIdleMemoryLimit`. It looks like the fix and is not, for a
    // reason the same line of Jest source explains: setting it is precisely what
    // *disables* in-band execution (`workerIdleMemoryLimit === undefined &&
    // (oneWorkerOrLess || …)`). So it does not "recycle the worker" — it forks
    // one that did not exist before, then restarts it whenever RSS crosses the
    // limit, each restart discarding the whole `node_modules` require cache.
    // Measured on the machine that has the problem: 1894 s against 1030 s for
    // the same suite, with RSS held near 500 MB. A ceiling is the cheap lever;
    // this is not. The growth itself is still worth fixing at the source.
